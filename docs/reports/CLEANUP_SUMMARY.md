```

### Maintenance Recommendations

1. **Regular cleanup**: Run `npm prune` monthly
2. **Documentation**: Keep reports in organized `/docs/` structure
3. **Backups**: Archive before removing, maintain 30-day retention
4. **Git hygiene**: Use `.gitignore` for all generated/temporary files

### Next Steps

1. Run `npm install` when needed to restore dependencies
2. Review remaining files in root directory for further organization
3. Consider automated cleanup scripts for temporary files
4. Set up CI/CD hooks for maintaining clean structure
