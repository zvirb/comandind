# Orchestrator Governance

## Layered Orchestration Model

The `ProjectOrchestrator` now operates at a strategic level, delegating tactical execution to the `TeamSupervisor`. This layered model improves efficiency and focus.

## Real-Time Context Management

Context is no longer a batch process. The `KnowledgeBroker` provides real-time, on-demand context and knowledge management.

## Continuous Feedback Loop

The `FeedbackLoopAgent` enables continuous system improvement by systematically capturing and storing feedback from operational outcomes and human interaction.
