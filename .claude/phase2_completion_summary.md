â”œâ”€â”€ Resource Type: Config-intensive
â””â”€â”€ Success Gate: 95% confidence threshold

STREAM 2 - PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (GPU + Database):
â”œâ”€â”€ GPU Sub-stream: CPU-intensive agents
â”œâ”€â”€ Database Sub-stream: I/O-intensive agents  
â”œâ”€â”€ Dependencies: Can execute parallel with Stream 1
â””â”€â”€ Success Gate: 80%+ confidence threshold

STREAM 3 - COMMUNICATION ENHANCEMENT (Service Communication):
â”œâ”€â”€ Resource Type: Network-intensive
â”œâ”€â”€ Dependencies: Independent execution
â””â”€â”€ Success Gate: 85% confidence threshold
```
