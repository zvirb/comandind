# Cognitive Services SSL Fix Deployment Summary

## Deployment Execution Time
- **Start Time**: 15:08:40 (16 Aug 2025)
- **Current Time**: 15:17:00 (16 Aug 2025)
- **Duration**: ~9 minutes

## Service Status

### ✅ Successful Deployments
1. **Learning Service**
   - Status: HEALTHY
   - Neo4j: Connected
   - Qdrant: Connected  
   - Redis: Connected
   - Knowledge Graph: 156 nodes, 289 edges
   - Uptime: Stable

### ⚠️ Services Under Recovery
1. **Hybrid-Memory Service**
   - Status: UNHEALTHY (Missing faker dependency)
   - Action: Rebuilding with faker==33.1.0
   - Container: Restarting after rebuild

2. **Reasoning Service**
   - Status: UNHEALTHY 
   - Issue: Port configuration mismatch
   - Logs show running on port 8003 instead of 8005

3. **Coordination Service**
   - Status: UNHEALTHY
   - Issue: Health check failing
   - Logs show service started but health endpoint not responding

## Deployment Actions Completed
- ✅ SSL environment variables added to all services
- ✅ Neo4j authentication configured for learning service
- ✅ All containers rebuilt with parallel execution
- ✅ Services restarted with new configuration
- ✅ Learning service fully operational

## Outstanding Issues
- [ ] Hybrid-memory service: Faker dependency installation
- [ ] Reasoning service: Port configuration correction  
- [ ] Coordination service: Health endpoint investigation
- [ ] SSL error validation pending for all services

## Evidence Collection
- Container rebuild logs: deployment_build.log
- Deployment execution log: deployment.log
- Service health checks: 30 attempts completed
- Learning service confirmed healthy with full connectivity

## Next Steps
1. Complete hybrid-memory rebuild with faker
2. Fix reasoning service port configuration
3. Debug coordination service health endpoint
4. Validate SSL errors eliminated across all services
