# WebUI Infrastructure Configuration Analysis

## Docker Build Strategy
- Multi-stage build process
- Node.js 18 Alpine base image
- Optimized dependency management
- Minimal production image size

## Security Configurations
1. User Management
   - Non-root user execution
   - Explicit user and group creation
   - Principle of least privilege

2. Network Configuration
   - Single port exposure (3001)
   - Health check endpoint verification

## Performance Optimization Techniques
- Separate build and runtime stages
- Production-only dependency installation
- Cache cleaning
- Minimal container overhead

## Recommended Improvements
- Consider using multi-arch builds
- Implement more granular health checks
- Add runtime performance monitoring
