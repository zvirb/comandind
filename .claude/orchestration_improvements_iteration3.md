## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR ITERATION 3

### MUST ACHIEVE:
```yaml
service_health:
  - reasoning-service: "healthy"
  - hybrid-memory-service: "healthy"
  - coordination-service: "healthy"
  - learning-service: "healthy"
  - perception-service: "healthy"

api_functionality:
  - /api/v1/chat: "200 OK on POST"
  - /api/v1/auth/session: "200 OK"
  - /api/v1/projects: "200 OK with auth"

user_experience:
  - chat_response_time: "< 5 seconds"
  - session_persistence: "no logouts"
  - authentication_flow: "fully functional"

evidence_collection:
  - playwright_tests: "100% with screenshots"
  - console_errors: "captured and addressed"
  - api_responses: "documented with headers"
```

### NICE TO HAVE:
```yaml
performance_optimization:
  - chat_response_time: "< 2 seconds"
  - page_load_time: "< 1 second"
  - animation_fps: "> 60fps"

additional_features:
  - document_management: "functional"
  - calendar_integration: "operational"
  - project_workflows: "accessible"
```

## üö® ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Claim success without Playwright evidence
- Refactor working code while fixing issues
- Skip health checks before implementation
- Ignore console errors during testing
- Proceed with unhealthy services
- Make architectural changes during fixes

### ‚úÖ ALWAYS:
- Use evidence-based validation
- Fix health issues first
- Test with real user workflows
- Capture screenshots for proof
- Document all findings
- Maintain working components

## üìä EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### Iteration 3 Target Metrics:
```yaml
success_rate: 95%  # Up from 60% in iteration 2
evidence_coverage: 100%  # Maintain from iteration 2
false_positive_rate: 0%  # Maintain from iteration 2
service_health: 100%  # Up from 60% in iteration 2
api_functionality: 100%  # Up from 25% in iteration 2
user_satisfaction: "HIGH"  # Full functionality restored
```

### Knowledge Graph Enrichment:
- Document successful recovery patterns
- Capture service dependency relationships
- Record API implementation requirements
- Store validation test configurations
