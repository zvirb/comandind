# Phase 2: Strategic Infrastructure Planning - Iteration 2 Output

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Infrastructure-First Methodology Required

### Executive Summary
**5 of 9 cognitive services are unhealthy and non-responsive**. Previous iteration had **70% false positive rate** in validation claims. Infrastructure must be restored BEFORE any authentication or feature work can succeed.

## Strategic Context Package (3000 tokens)

### 1. Implementation Methodology: INFRASTRUCTURE-FIRST

**Execution Sequence:**
1. **Container Health Crisis Resolution** (PRIORITY 1)
   - Diagnose why 5 cognitive services are unhealthy
   - Restore services in dependency order
   - Validate with concrete evidence (no false positives)

2. **Service Health Validation** (PRIORITY 2)
   - Health endpoint testing with curl responses
   - Inter-service communication validation
   - Database and Redis connectivity verification

3. **Authentication Restoration** (PRIORITY 3)
   - PRESERVE unified router work (8â†’1 consolidation)
   - Test on healthy infrastructure only
   - Validate WebSocket and session management

4. **User Feature Validation** (PRIORITY 4)
   - Playwright automation for real testing
   - Chat, Documents, Calendar functionality
   - Production site validation (http/https://aiwfe.com)

### 2. Agent Coordination Strategy

**Phase 3 Research Teams (PARALLEL EXECUTION):**

**Infrastructure Crisis Team:**
- `infrastructure-recovery`: Docker container diagnosis
- `monitoring-analyst`: Health check analysis
- `deployment-orchestrator`: Restoration planning

**Service Dependency Team:**
- `dependency-analyzer`: Map service dependencies
- `performance-profiler`: Resource utilization analysis
- `backend-gateway-expert`: API health validation

**Evidence Validation Team:**
- `user-experience-auditor`: Playwright test automation
- `production-endpoint-validator`: Production verification
- `evidence-auditor`: Validate all success claims

**Authentication Preservation Team:**
- `security-validator`: Auth flow verification
- `fullstack-communication-auditor`: Session management

### 3. Evidence-Based Validation Requirements

**MANDATORY for ALL Claims:**
- Container health: `docker ps` output, `docker inspect` results
- Service health: curl responses with body content
- User features: Playwright screenshots of working functionality
- Production: curl/ping evidence from aiwfe.com sites

**False Positive Prevention:**
- NO success claims without evidence artifacts
- Evidence-auditor reviews ALL validation claims
- User testing MANDATORY before phase completion
- 100% evidence backing required for success

### 4. Risk Mitigation Strategy

**Infrastructure Risks:**
- Create container snapshots before changes
- Use controlled restart with dependency ordering
- Maintain network configuration backups

**Authentication Preservation:**
- Test auth after EACH service restoration
- Checkpoint configuration before changes
- Maintain fallback to iteration 1 work

**Validation Enforcement:**
- Evidence artifacts required for phase completion
- Audit review mandatory before claiming success
- Iteration if validation shows continued failures

### 5. Critical Success Criteria

**Infrastructure Success:**
- ALL containers show healthy in `docker ps`
- ALL service health endpoints return 200 OK
- NO critical errors in container logs

**Authentication Success:**
- Login works with JWT generation
- WebSocket connects with authentication
- Session persists across feature navigation

**User Feature Success:**
- Chat: Messages sent AND AI responds
- Documents: Navigate without logout
- Calendar: Navigate without logout
- Production: Both http/https sites accessible

## Next Phase Requirements

**Phase 3: Multi-Domain Research Discovery**
- Focus on container health root causes
- Map service dependencies for restoration order
- Identify resource constraints and network issues
- Plan evidence collection mechanisms

**Checkpoint Created:** `checkpoint_phase_2_50054`

## Implementation Directive for Main Claude

**CRITICAL**: The infrastructure is in crisis. 5 cognitive services are down. Authentication work from iteration 1 must be preserved but cannot function until infrastructure is healthy.

**Your coordination priority:**
1. Launch infrastructure diagnosis teams IMMEDIATELY
2. Get concrete evidence of failures (logs, health checks)
3. Plan restoration in dependency order
4. Validate EVERYTHING with evidence before claiming success

**Remember**: 70% of previous claims were false positives. We need PROOF, not promises.
