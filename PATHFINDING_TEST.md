# 🗺️ Pathfinding System Testing Guide

## ✨ New Features Added

Your RTS game now has intelligent pathfinding with A* algorithm!

### **What's Working:**

1. **A* Pathfinding**
   - Optimal path calculation
   - Diagonal movement support
   - Path smoothing for natural movement
   - Path caching for performance

2. **Navigation Grid**
   - Dynamic obstacle avoidance
   - Buildings block paths
   - Units avoid each other
   - 16x16 pixel grid cells

3. **Group Movement**
   - Box formation (default)
   - Line formation
   - Wedge formation
   - Smart spacing between units

4. **Debug Visualization**
   - Press 'P' to toggle pathfinding debug mode
   - Shows navigation grid (red = blocked, green = walkable)
   - Displays path lines in cyan
   - Yellow dots show waypoints

## 🎮 Testing Instructions

### Basic Pathfinding Test:
1. **Select a unit** (click on it)
2. **Right-click** somewhere on the map
3. Unit should find path around obstacles

### Group Movement Test:
1. **Box select multiple units** (click and drag)
2. **Right-click** to move them
3. Units should move in formation

### Obstacle Avoidance Test:
1. Place units near buildings
2. Try to move them to the other side
3. Units should path around buildings

### Debug Mode Test:
1. **Press 'P'** to enable debug visualization
2. Red cells show blocked areas (buildings)
3. Cyan lines show calculated paths
4. Yellow dots show path waypoints

## 🎯 Controls Summary

```
SELECTION:
├─ Click: Select single unit
├─ Box drag: Select multiple units
└─ Right-click: Move to location

DEBUG:
├─ P: Toggle pathfinding visualization
├─ 1: Add 100 test sprites
├─ 2: Stress test (1000 sprites)
└─ 0: Clear all sprites

CAMERA:
├─ WASD/Arrows: Move camera
├─ Pinch: Zoom (trackpad)
├─ Two-finger swipe: Pan (trackpad)
└─ Mouse wheel: Zoom (mouse)
```

## 📊 What to Look For

### ✅ Working Correctly:
- Units take shortest path to destination
- Units go around buildings
- Multiple units maintain formation
- Paths update when obstacles move
- Debug grid shows correct blocked areas

### ⚠️ Known Limitations:
- Units may overlap when arriving at same point
- Very narrow passages might be impassable
- Large groups may take time to calculate paths

## 🔍 Debug Information

When debug mode is ON (Press 'P'), you'll see:

1. **Grid Visualization**
   - Red squares: Blocked cells
   - Green lines: Walkable grid

2. **Path Visualization**
   - Cyan line: Calculated path
   - Yellow circles: Waypoints
   - Path updates in real-time

3. **Console Output**
   - "Pathfinding debug mode: true/false"
   - Warning if no path found
   - Unit creation messages

## 🚀 Performance Notes

- Grid size: 2000x2000 pixels
- Cell size: 16x16 pixels
- Path caching: Last 100 paths
- Supports 100+ units pathfinding simultaneously

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Units not moving?
1. Check console for "No path found" messages
2. Enable debug mode (P) to see blocked areas
3. Destination might be blocked

### Units moving through buildings?
1. Buildings might not be registered as obstacles
2. Check if building was created after pathfinding system

### Performance issues?
1. Reduce number of units
2. Disable debug visualization (P)
3. Clear test sprites (0)

## 🎮 Advanced Features

### Formation Types (in code):
- `box`: Square formation (default)
- `line`: Horizontal line
- `wedge`: Triangle formation

### Pathfinding Settings:
- Diagonal movement: Enabled
- Path smoothing: Enabled
- Max search nodes: 1000
- Arrival distance: 5 pixels

The pathfinding system is now fully integrated and ready for testing! Try selecting units and moving them around buildings to see the intelligent pathfinding in action.
