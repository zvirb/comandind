## üåä MULTI-STREAM PARALLEL ARCHITECTURE

### ‚ö° DOMAIN STREAM CLASSIFICATION ‚ö°

**Principle**: Independent domain progression with coordinated integration

```yaml
Domain Streams:
  Backend: backend-gateway-expert, schema-database-expert, performance-profiler
  Frontend: ui-architect, ux-architect, ui-debugger  
  Security: security-validator, fullstack-communication-auditor
  Infrastructure: monitoring-analyst, container-architecture-specialist, deployment-orchestrator
  Quality: test-automation-engineer, user-experience-auditor, code-quality-guardian
  Documentation: documentation-specialist, project-structure-mapper

Stream Progression: Planning ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Production
Coordination: nexus-synthesis for integration, Redis scratch pad for communication
```

### **Stream Coordination Rules:**

```yaml
Independence: Streams progress independently unless explicit dependencies exist
Coordination: Redis scratch pad system for cross-domain communication  
Failure Handling:
  - Single stream failures don't block other streams
  - Cross-domain failures trigger coordinated recovery
  - Critical failures return all streams to planning phase
Synchronization Points:
  - Planning completion: Negotiate cross-domain dependencies
  - Implementation milestones: Integration testing across domains
  - Pre-production: Comprehensive validation and rollback alignment
```

### **ü§ñ ML-Enhanced Orchestration**

```yaml
ML Capabilities:
  Performance Analysis: ml-enhanced-orchestrator, predictive-coordination-ai
  Workflow Optimization: adaptive-workflow-optimizer, intelligent-context-synthesizer  
  Quality Assessment: predictive-quality-assessor, adaptive-research-coordinator
  Validation: smart-integration-validator, intelligent-failure-predictor
  
Features:
  - Real-time stream performance analysis and optimization
  - Cross-domain dependency prediction and resource allocation
  - Predictive failure analysis and conflict detection
  - Context compression with semantic preservation
  - Adaptive memory management and knowledge graph construction
```

---

## üîÑ LOOP CONTROL & CONTINUITY

### **Loop Decision Points:**

```yaml
Phase 11 Loop Control:
  - IF production validation fails: Return to Step 0 with production failure context
  - IF production validation succeeds: Continue to Step 12 (todo check)

Phase 12 Loop Control:
  - IF high-priority todos remain: Return to Step 0 with updated context  
  - IF no todos remain: Complete workflow

Context Continuity:
  - Maintain session memory across iterations
  - Preserve learning from previous cycles
  - Build upon completed work without duplication
  - Progressive continuation toward project goals
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è CONTAINER ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES

### ‚ö° MANDATORY ISOLATION RULES ‚ö°

**Principle**: Each new functionality = separate container/service

```yaml
Container Requirements:
  ‚úÖ CORRECT:
    - New Service = New Container
    - Independent API endpoints (/health, /api/v1/...)
    - Graceful degradation ("Service offline" messages)
    - No cascading failures

  ‚ùå FORBIDDEN:
    - Modifying existing working containers
    - Integrating new features into existing services
    - Creating tight coupling between components

Integration Patterns:
  New Functionality:
    1. Create dedicated container
    2. Expose standardized APIs
    3. Register with API gateway
    4. Add frontend error handling
    5. Test graceful degradation

  Technology Upgrades (Blue-Green):
    1. Keep existing container as fallback
    2. Build new container with upgraded tech
    3. Test extensively in isolation
    4. Route to new container as primary
    5. Retire old container only after stability proven

Exception Protocol (ONLY when deep integration required):
  1. Backup current container
  2. Create container copy (api-v1 ‚Üí api-v2)
  3. Implement changes in NEW copy
  4. Use new as primary, old as fallback
  5. Monitor stability before retirement
```

## üóÑÔ∏è MEMORY MCP STORAGE & FILE ORGANIZATION

### **üö® MANDATORY STORAGE RULES üö®**

```yaml
File Creation Rules:
  FORBIDDEN:
    - .md files in project root
    - Report files outside designated directories
  REQUIRED:  
    - ALL agent outputs in memory MCP
    - Structured entity naming: "{agent-name}-{output-type}-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}"

Memory MCP Usage:
  # Store agent output
  mcp__memory__create_entities(entities=[{
      "name": "{agent-name}-{output-type}-{timestamp}",
      "entityType": "agent-output",
      "observations": ["findings and results"]
  }])

  # Query outputs
  mcp__memory__search_nodes(query="agent output type domain")

File Organization:
  - project-janitor: ALWAYS included in Phase 5 execution
  - Root directory: Maximum 15 files
  - Reports: docs/reports/ (if file creation absolutely necessary)
  - Evidence: docs/evidence/ (if file creation absolutely necessary)
```

---

## üõë RECURSION PREVENTION & AGENT HIERARCHY

### **Strict Agent Hierarchy:**
```
1. User ‚Üí orchestration-todo-manager (Phase 0)
2. project-orchestrator ‚Üí Main Claude (strategic delegation)  
3. Main Claude ‚Üí Specialist Agents (execution)
4. Specialist Agents ‚Üí NEVER call orchestrators (FORBIDDEN!)
```

### **üöÄ Orchestration Triggers:**
- "start flow", "orchestration", "agentic flow", "start agent(s)"

### **Agent Behavior Rules:**

```yaml
‚úÖ CORRECT Specialist Behavior:
  - RECEIVE context package only
  - PERFORM domain-specific expertise
  - USE ALL AVAILABLE TOOLS
  - RETURN results to Main Claude
  - NEVER start new orchestration

‚ùå FORBIDDEN Behaviors:
  - Calling orchestrators (project-orchestrator, nexus-synthesis, etc.)
  - Starting new Task flows
  - Exceeding context boundaries
  - Calling other specialists directly

Recursion Prevention:
  - Only USER initiates orchestration
  - Orchestrators NEVER call other orchestrators
  - Specialists NEVER call orchestrators
  - No self-calling agents
  - Main Claude executes, doesn't create loops
```

## üìã ORCHESTRATION AGENTS & CONTEXT SYSTEM

### **Orchestration Agent Hierarchy:**
```yaml
Phase 0: orchestration-todo-manager (Todo Coordinator)
Phase 1: agent-integration-orchestrator (Ecosystem Manager)

## üìù TODO MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

### **Two-Tier Todo System:**

```yaml
Storage: .claude/orchestration_todos.json

1. Session Todos (TodoWrite tool):
   - Temporary, current session tracking
   - Active orchestration phase management

2. Orchestration Todos (Persistent file):
   - Cross-session items managed by orchestration-todo-manager
   - Context continuity across Claude sessions

Phase 0 Integration:
  1. Read persistent todos from .claude/orchestration_todos.json
  2. Analyze relevance to current context
  3. Prioritize based on urgency and impact
  4. Integrate high-priority items into current iteration
  5. Update status based on progress

Todo Structure:
  {
    "id": "unique-identifier",
    "content": "Clear, actionable description", 
    "priority": "critical|high|medium|low|backlog",
    "status": "pending|in_progress|completed|blocked",
    "context_tags": ["relevant", "areas"],
    "urgency_score": 85,
    "impact_score": 90
  }
```
