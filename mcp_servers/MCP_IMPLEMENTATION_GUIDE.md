# MCP Server Implementation Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

The MCP servers required for the AI Workflow Orchestration have been successfully implemented and are now running.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Start the integrated MCP server
./start_integrated_mcp.sh

# Test the server
python3 test_integrated_mcp.py

# Stop the server
./stop_integrated_mcp.sh
```

## 📍 Server Details

### Integrated MCP Server
- **URL**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Status**: http://localhost:8000/status
- **Health**: http://localhost:8000/health

This single server provides both Memory and Redis MCP functionality:

#### Memory MCP Features
- Entity storage and retrieval
- Full-text search across entities
- Knowledge graph relationships
- Persistent file-based storage
- Token limit enforcement

#### Redis MCP Features  
- Hash operations for shared workspace
- Set operations for agent notifications
- Sorted set operations for timeline tracking
- In-memory storage for real-time coordination

## 🔧 Usage in Workflow

The MCP servers are now ready to be used in the AI Workflow Orchestration:

### Memory MCP Usage
```python
# Store agent output
POST http://localhost:8000/mcp/memory/create_entities
{
  "name": "agent-output-20250818",
  "entityType": "agent-output",
  "observations": ["Result 1", "Result 2"]
}

# Search stored knowledge
POST http://localhost:8000/mcp/memory/search_nodes
{
  "query": "search term",
  "entityType": "agent-output"
}
```

### Redis MCP Usage
```python
# Store shared workspace data
POST http://localhost:8000/mcp/redis/hset
{
  "key": "workspace:phase3",
  "field": "status",
  "value": "in_progress"
}

# Agent notifications
POST http://localhost:8000/mcp/redis/sadd
{
  "key": "notifications:agents",
  "members": ["agent1", "agent2"]
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

The server has been tested and verified with:
- ✅ Health checks passing
- ✅ Memory entity creation and search
- ✅ Redis hash, set, and sorted set operations
- ✅ Status endpoint reporting correctly

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. The MCP servers are running and ready for use
2. The workflow configuration in `CLAUDE.md` has been cleaned of project-specific information
3. The `.claude` folder contains generic templates ready for customization
4. You can now use the orchestration workflow with these MCP servers

## 📝 Notes

- The integrated server runs on port 8000 (single endpoint for both MCP types)
- Data is persisted in `mcp_servers/storage/` directory
- The server uses a Python virtual environment (`mcp_venv/`)
- Process ID is saved in `mcp_server.pid` for easy management

## 🛑 Troubleshooting

If the server fails to start:
1. Check if port 8000 is already in use: `lsof -i :8000`
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed: `python3 --version`
3. Check the virtual environment: `source mcp_venv/bin/activate`
4. Manually install dependencies: `pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic`

## 🎉 Success!

The MCP servers are now fully operational and ready to support the AI Workflow Orchestration system!
