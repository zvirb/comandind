## üöÄ Production Deployment Capabilities

### Zero-Downtime Deployments
```bash
# Deploy new version with automatic rollback on failure
VERSION=v1.0.0 ./deployment/scripts/deploy.sh deploy

# Monitor deployment status in real-time
watch -n 5 './deployment/scripts/deploy.sh status'
```

### Intelligent Health Monitoring
```bash
# Comprehensive health validation
curl http://localhost/health/detailed

# Health monitor status with metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/status | jq '.'
```

### Automatic Rollback System
```bash
# Automatic rollback if active slot unhealthy
./deployment/scripts/rollback.sh auto

# Manual rollback with audit trail
./deployment/scripts/rollback.sh manual blue "emergency-fix"
```

### Container Orchestration
```bash
# Complete blue-green infrastructure
docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose/docker-compose.blue-green.yml up -d

# Monitor all service health
docker compose ps && docker compose logs --tail=20
```
