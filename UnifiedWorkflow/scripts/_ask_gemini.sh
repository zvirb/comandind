The setup script failed. Here are the contents of the error log file that was generated.

Can you please analyze the error and suggest a fix?

--- END ERROR LOG ---

For additional context, I can provide files like docker-compose.yml, setup scripts, etc. if you ask for them.
Please keep in mind @orchestration_detail.txt if dealing with docker containers setup and execution (not internal code)"
