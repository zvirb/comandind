# Critical Production Incident Report - Redis Connection Failure
**Date:** August 6, 2025
**Severity:** P0 - Critical
**Duration:** ~4 hours
**Status:** RESOLVED

## Executive Summary
A critical production incident occurred where the Redis service became disconnected from the application network, causing complete authentication failure and backend service degradation at aiwfe.com.

## Impact
- **Authentication System:** Complete failure - users unable to log in
- **CSRF Protection:** Token generation failed due to Redis dependency
- **Backend Health:** Degraded status reported
- **User Experience:** Complete service unavailability for authenticated features

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue
The Redis container (`ai_workflow_engine-redis-1`) was running on a different Docker network (`ai_workflow_test`) than the API service (`ai_workflow_engine_ai_workflow_engine_net`), preventing network communication between services.

### Contributing Factors
1. **Network Isolation:** Redis container was isolated on wrong network
2. **ACL Configuration:** Redis ACL users were not properly loaded initially
3. **Secret Mounting:** Redis secrets were not properly mounted in first attempt

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Network Connectivity Fix
```bash
# Connected Redis to the correct network
docker network connect ai_workflow_engine_ai_workflow_engine_net ai_workflow_engine-redis-1
```

### 2. Redis Service Restart
```bash
# Properly restarted Redis via docker-compose to ensure configuration
docker compose down redis
docker compose up -d redis
```

### 3. API Service Restart
```bash
# Restarted API to reconnect to Redis
docker restart ai_workflow_engine-api-1
```

## Verification Results
- **Redis Connection:** ✅ Successful (`redis_connection": "ok"`)
- **CSRF Token Endpoint:** ✅ Working (`/api/v1/auth/csrf-token` returns tokens)
- **Backend Health:** ✅ Healthy (`{"status":"ok","redis_connection":"ok"}`)
- **Authentication:** ✅ Restored

## Prevention Measures

### Immediate Actions
1. **Network Configuration:** Ensure all services are on the same Docker network
2. **Health Monitoring:** Enhanced monitoring for Redis connectivity
3. **Documentation:** This incident report for future reference

### Recommended Long-term Improvements
1. **Docker Compose Enhancement:** Add explicit network configuration to prevent drift
2. **Startup Validation:** Add pre-flight checks for critical service dependencies
3. **Monitoring Alerts:** Implement automated alerts for Redis disconnection
4. **Graceful Degradation:** Improve error handling when Redis is unavailable

## Technical Details

### Redis ACL Configuration (Working)
```
user default off sanitize-payload resetchannels -@all
user lwe-app on sanitize-payload #<hashed_password> ~* &* +@all +@pubsub
```

### Network Configuration (Correct)
- Network: `ai_workflow_engine_ai_workflow_engine_net`
- Services: api, redis, postgres, qdrant, caddy (all on same network)

### Health Check Command (For Monitoring)
```bash
curl -k -s https://aiwfe.com/api/v1/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","redis_connection":"ok"}
```

## Lessons Learned
1. **Network Isolation:** Docker network configuration is critical for service communication
2. **Dependency Management:** Redis is a critical dependency for authentication
3. **Monitoring Gaps:** Need better visibility into service connectivity
4. **Recovery Time:** Manual intervention required ~30 minutes to diagnose and fix

## Action Items
- [ ] Update docker-compose.yml to explicitly define network membership
- [ ] Implement Redis connection monitoring in health checks
- [ ] Add automated recovery scripts for common failure scenarios
- [ ] Review and update runbooks for Redis-related incidents
