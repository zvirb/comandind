## Measuring Rule Effectiveness

### Key Metrics
```yaml
success_metrics:
  - "Actual vs claimed success rate convergence"
  - "System health degradation incidents reduction"  
  - "Integration failure detection rate improvement"
  - "Time from failure to recovery reduction"
  - "User functionality preservation during workflows"

failure_prevention_metrics:
  - "Caught scope violations before system impact"
  - "Integration conflicts detected before deployment"
  - "False success reports eliminated"
  - "Automatic rollbacks triggered appropriately"
```

### Continuous Improvement
- Monthly rule effectiveness review
- Failed workflow analysis for new rule creation
- Success pattern recognition for rule optimization
- Integration with orchestration system feedback loops

**These rules represent learnings from a catastrophic orchestration failure and must be implemented to prevent similar disasters in the future.**
