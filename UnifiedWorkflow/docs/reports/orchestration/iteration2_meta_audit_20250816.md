validation_implementation:
  actual_execution: "Parallel framework + testing (20 min)"
  previous_iteration: "No validation at all"
  improvement: "‚àû% (from nothing to comprehensive)"
  
infrastructure_recovery:
  actual_execution: "Focused Qdrant fix (15 min)"
  optimal_execution: "Full cognitive services recovery (30 min)"
  gap: "Partial fix - other services still unhealthy"
```

### Resource Utilization
- **Agent Coordination**: IMPROVED - Clear focus on infrastructure + validation
- **Evidence Collection**: EXCELLENT - All claims now evidence-based
- **Scope Management**: GOOD - Avoided authentication refactoring rabbit hole

## üö® Failure Pattern Analysis (MAST Framework)

### Successfully Prevented Failure Modes

#### 1. **FM-3.2 No or Incomplete Verification** - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
- **Iteration 1**: No validation performed at all
- **Iteration 2**: Comprehensive Playwright testing with evidence
- **Prevention**: Mandatory evidence-based validation framework

#### 2. **FM-3.3 Incorrect Verification** - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
- **Iteration 1**: False success claims without testing
- **Iteration 2**: Accurate failure reporting with evidence
- **Prevention**: Real browser automation testing

### Remaining Failure Modes

#### 1. **FM-2.6 Reasoning-Action Mismatch** - PARTIAL
- **Pattern**: Infrastructure fixes don't fully restore functionality
- **Evidence**: Qdrant fixed but chat still times out
- **Root Cause**: Incomplete understanding of service dependencies

#### 2. **Service Health Cascade** - NEW DISCOVERY
- **Pattern**: Multiple cognitive services showing "unhealthy"
- **Services**: hybrid-memory, reasoning, learning, coordination, perception
- **Impact**: Core AI functionality compromised despite infrastructure fixes

    - "Session must persist across navigation"

api_endpoint_fixes:
  critical_errors:
    - "/api/v1/chat - 405 Method Not Allowed (needs POST handler)"
    - "/api/v1/auth/session - 404 Not Found (route missing)"
    - "/api/v1/projects - 401 Unauthorized (auth broken)"
  
  required_evidence:
