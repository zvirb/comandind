# File Organization Cleanup Report
**Date**: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')  
**Agent**: project-janitor  
**Mission**: WebUI Flickering Investigation File Organization

## Executive Summary

Successfully organized project structure for WebUI flickering investigation while maintaining compliance with CLAUDE.md file organization standards.

## Key Achievements

### ✅ Project Root Compliance
- **Final Count**: 15 files (exactly meeting CLAUDE.md maximum requirement)
- **Reduction**: From 27 files to 15 files (44% reduction)
- **Core Files Preserved**: All essential project files maintained

### ✅ Evidence File Organization
- **Created Structure**: Organized .playwright-mcp/ evidence into 4 investigation phases
- **Evidence Index**: Created EVIDENCE_INDEX.md for investigation continuity
- **Accessibility**: All evidence preserved and properly categorized

### ✅ Temporary File Cleanup
- **Consolidated**: 7 temporary files moved to temp_cleanup/ directory
- **Categories**: Debug scripts, authentication files, session data
- **Preserved**: All files accessible for potential debugging needs

### ✅ Configuration Organization
- **Environment Files**: Moved .env and local.env to config/ directory
- **Evidence Files**: Moved investigation artifacts to docs/evidence/
- **Backup Files**: Moved docker-compose backups to backups/ directory

## Investigation Artifacts Preserved

### Evidence Files
- **120+ Playwright screenshots** organized by investigation phase
- **WebUI flickering evidence** properly categorized
- **Authentication validation** screenshots preserved
- **Production validation** evidence maintained

### Context Packages
- **Verified organization** in .claude/context_packages/
- **Size compliance** with 4000 token limits
- **Investigation continuity** maintained

## Compliance Verification

✅ **CLAUDE.md Requirements Met**:
- Project root: 15 files (≤ 15 files requirement)
- Evidence accessibility preserved
- Investigation artifacts properly organized
- No critical files displaced

✅ **Organization Standards**:
- Established directory structure patterns followed
- Evidence categorized by investigation phase
- Temporary files consolidated without loss
- Configuration files properly located

## Maintenance Recommendations

1. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Use .file_placement_guard.py to prevent root directory bloat
2. **Evidence Management**: Continue organizing screenshots by investigation phase
3. **Cleanup Schedule**: Periodic review of temp_cleanup/ directory
4. **Documentation**: Update EVIDENCE_INDEX.md for new investigations

## Investigation Continuity

All WebUI flickering investigation artifacts remain accessible:
- **Historical evidence** for regression analysis
- **Validation benchmarks** for performance comparison  
- **Debugging resources** for future troubleshooting
- **User experience validation** documentation preserved

---

**Result**: Clean, organized project structure maintaining investigation evidence accessibility while achieving full compliance with project file organization standards.
