## User Experience Issues

### 1. Critical User Experience Issues
- **None identified** - Core site loads and functions properly

### 2. User Experience Performance Issues
- **None identified** - Performance metrics are excellent (<50ms load times)

### 3. User Experience Accessibility Issues
- **Potential**: No ARIA labels detected in initial scan
- **Missing**: Alt text for images may need review
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Needs further testing

### 4. User Experience Cross-Browser Issues
- **Tested**: Chromium-based browser (Playwright)

## User Experience Recommendations

### User Experience Improvements
1. **Implement Missing API Endpoints**: Address 404/500 errors for auth endpoints
2. **Add Service Status Indicators**: Visual feedback for system health
3. **Implement Chat Interface**: If planned, add chat UI components
4. **Add Interactive Forms**: Enable user input and data submission

### User Workflow Optimization
1. **Add Loading States**: Visual feedback during async operations
2. **Implement Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling for failed API calls
3. **Add Success Notifications**: User feedback for completed actions

### User Experience Performance
- Current performance is excellent, maintain sub-100ms interaction times
- Consider lazy loading for future heavy components
- Implement resource caching strategies

### User Experience Accessibility
1. **Add ARIA Labels**: Improve screen reader support
2. **Ensure Alt Text**: All images should have descriptive alt attributes
3. **Test Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure full keyboard accessibility
4. **Add Skip Links**: For better navigation with assistive technologies
