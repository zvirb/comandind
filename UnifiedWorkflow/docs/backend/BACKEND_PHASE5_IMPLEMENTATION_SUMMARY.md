### ✅ Task 4: API Performance and Reliability
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Implementation**:
- Added comprehensive health check endpoints for monitoring
- Implemented performance tracking middleware with response time monitoring
- Created detailed monitoring endpoints for system validation
- Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the API layer

**New Files Created**:
- `/app/api/routers/monitoring_endpoints_router.py` - Backend monitoring and validation endpoints
- `/app/api/middleware/performance_tracking_middleware.py` - Request performance tracking

**Enhanced Health Check Endpoints**:
- `/api/v1/health/detailed` - Comprehensive system health with performance metrics
- `/api/v1/health/ready` - Kubernetes-style readiness probe  
- `/api/v1/health/live` - Kubernetes-style liveness probe

**Monitoring Endpoints** (at `/api/v1/monitoring/`):
- `GET /metrics/performance` - API performance metrics and response times
- `GET /metrics/database` - Database performance and connection metrics
- `GET /validate/endpoints` - Critical endpoint validation
- `GET /validate/authentication` - Authentication system validation
- `GET /system/info` - System information and runtime details
