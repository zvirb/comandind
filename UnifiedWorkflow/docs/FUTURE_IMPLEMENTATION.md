## Implementation Notes

### Google OAuth Architecture
The OAuth implementation uses a secure, user-centric approach:
- Each user connects their own Google account
- Tokens are stored encrypted with proper scope management
- Refresh tokens handle automatic renewal
- Services can be connected/disconnected individually

### Database Schema Considerations
The `user_oauth_tokens` table includes:
- Service-specific user identification
- Scope tracking for permission management
- Created/updated timestamps for audit trails
- Unique constraints to prevent duplicate connections

### Security Considerations
- OAuth state parameter prevents CSRF attacks
- Tokens are stored as text (consider encryption)
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage
- Redirect URIs are validated

## Dependencies Required

### Python Packages
```
google-auth-oauthlib
google-api-python-client
google-auth
```

### Environment Variables
```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

### Google Cloud Console Setup
1. Create OAuth 2.0 client credentials
2. Configure authorized redirect URIs
3. Enable required APIs (Calendar, Drive, Gmail)
4. Set up proper scopes and permissions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] OAuth flow components
- [ ] Token storage and retrieval
- [ ] Service connection status
- [ ] Error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end OAuth flow
- [ ] Google API integration with real tokens
- [ ] Token refresh scenarios
- [ ] Service disconnection cleanup

### User Acceptance Tests
- [ ] Settings UI connection flow
- [ ] Service status display accuracy
- [ ] Error message clarity
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics to Track
- OAuth connection success/failure rates
- Token refresh frequency and success
- API call volumes per service
- User engagement with connected services

### Logging Requirements
- OAuth flow events (start, success, failure)
- Token refresh events
- API usage patterns
- Error conditions and resolutions
