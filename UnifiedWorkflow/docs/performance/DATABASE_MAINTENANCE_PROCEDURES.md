## 📊 Performance Monitoring Checklist

### Daily Monitoring Procedures (Automated)

#### 1. Response Time Validation (Every 5 minutes)
**Target**: <100ms average response time

**Monitoring Query**:
```sql
-- Database Response Time Check
SELECT 
    avg(response_time_ms) as avg_response_time,
    min(response_time_ms) as min_response_time,
    max(response_time_ms) as max_response_time,
    stddev(response_time_ms) as response_variance,
    count(*) as query_count
FROM performance_metrics 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '15 minutes';
```

**Alert Thresholds**:
- **Warning**: >80ms sustained for 10+ minutes
- **Critical**: >95ms sustained for 5+ minutes
- **Emergency**: >110ms sustained for 2+ minutes

**Response Actions**:
```yaml
Warning (80-95ms):

  2. Review active query patterns
  3. Validate index usage effectiveness
  4. Monitor memory and CPU utilization

Critical (95-110ms):
  1. Immediate Slack alert to database team
  2. Check for slow query patterns
  3. Validate connection pool health
  4. Review recent configuration changes

Emergency (>110ms):
  1. PagerDuty alert for immediate response
  2. Execute performance degradation runbook
  3. Consider emergency optimization procedures
  4. Escalate to senior database administrator
```

#### 2. Connection Pool Efficiency Check (Every 1 minute)

    cl_waiting as waiting_connections,
    sv_active as server_connections,
    sv_idle as idle_connections,
    (cl_active::float / sv_active) * 100 as pool_efficiency
FROM pgbouncer.pools 
WHERE database = 'aiwfe_production';
```

**Alert Thresholds**:
- **Warning**: <70% efficiency for 5+ minutes
- **Critical**: <60% efficiency for 2+ minutes
- **Emergency**: <50% efficiency or connection exhaustion

**Response Actions**:
```yaml
Warning (60-70% efficiency):
  1. Review connection usage patterns
  2. Check for connection leaks in application
  3. Monitor query execution times
  4. Validate pool configuration parameters

Emergency (<50% efficiency):
  1. Immediate database team notification
  2. Execute connection pool recovery procedures
  3. Check for database locks or deadlocks
  4. Implement emergency connection scaling
```

#### 3. Index Performance Analysis (Every 30 minutes)
**Target**: >90% index hit ratio for critical indexes

**Monitoring Query**:
```sql
-- Index Performance Health Check
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_tup_read,
    idx_tup_fetch,
    CASE 
        WHEN idx_tup_read = 0 THEN 0
        ELSE (idx_tup_fetch::float / idx_tup_read) * 100
    END as index_efficiency
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE indexname IN (
    'idx_users_username',
    'idx_users_email', 
    'idx_oauth_tokens_user_service',
    'idx_oauth_tokens_expiry'
)
ORDER BY index_efficiency DESC;
```

**Alert Thresholds**:
- **Warning**: Index efficiency <85% for critical indexes
- **Critical**: Index efficiency <80% for critical indexes
- **Emergency**: Index efficiency <70% or index not being used

**Response Actions**:
