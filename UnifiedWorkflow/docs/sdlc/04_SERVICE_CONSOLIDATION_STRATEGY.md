## Document Information

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: August 12, 2025  
**Authors**: System Architect, DevOps Lead  
**Reviewers**: Technical Team  
**Status**: Draft for Review  

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for consolidating the current 23-service Docker Compose deployment into an efficient 8-service Kubernetes-native architecture. The consolidation leverages smart agentic systems to replace multiple discrete services while improving performance, reducing resource usage, and simplifying operations.

### 2.2 Resource Usage Analysis

#### Current Resource Footprint
```yaml
Memory Usage:
  Database Layer: ~6GB (postgres, redis, qdrant)
  Application Layer: ~4GB (api, webui, worker, AI services)
  Monitoring Stack: ~8GB (prometheus, grafana, elasticsearch, etc.)
  Total: ~18GB+ memory

CPU Usage:
  Constant Load: ~4-6 CPU cores
  Peak Load: ~12-16 CPU cores
  
Storage:
  Database: ~20GB
  Logs: ~50GB (multiple systems)
  Monitoring Data: ~30GB
  Total: ~100GB
```

#### Identified Inefficiencies
1. **Duplicate Monitoring**: Multiple exporters vs. native K8s metrics
2. **Logging Complexity**: 5 different logging services running concurrently
3. **Service Sprawl**: 5 separate AI services for related functionality
4. **Manual Operations**: Certificate management, networking, scaling

## 3. Target State Architecture

### 3.1 Consolidated Service Map

#### Core Services (8)
1. **webui-service** - Next.js PWA with enhanced capabilities
2. **api-gateway** - Kong/Ambassador with integrated routing
3. **agent-engine** - Unified smart agentic system (replaces 5 AI services)
4. **chat-service** - AIWFE-powered conversational interface
5. **pieces-integration** - Pieces OS/Developers connectivity
6. **data-layer** - Operator-managed PostgreSQL + Redis + Qdrant
7. **ai-model-service** - Ollama with intelligent model management
8. **platform-services** - GitOps, monitoring, logging (K8s native)

### 3.2 Consolidation Benefits

#### Resource Reduction
```yaml
Memory Savings:
  Before: 18GB total memory usage
  After: 12GB total memory usage
  Reduction: 33% memory savings

CPU Savings:
  Before: 4-6 constant, 12-16 peak cores
  After: 2-4 constant, 8-12 peak cores
  Reduction: 40% CPU efficiency improvement

Service Count:
  Before: 30+ services
  After: 8 core services
  Reduction: 73% fewer services to manage
```

#### Operational Benefits
- **Simplified Deployment**: Single GitOps pipeline vs. 30+ service configurations
- **Improved Scaling**: Kubernetes HPA vs. manual scaling
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Native K8s observability vs. custom monitoring stack
- **Better Security**: Service mesh mTLS vs. manual certificate management
