Of course. Here is a synthesized project plan that consolidates all aspects discussed for building your native AI assistant client.

## AI Workflow Engine: Native Desktop Client Project Plan

This document outlines the development plan for a new native desktop client for the AI Workflow Engine. It builds upon the existing secure, feature-rich backend and WebUI, extending its capabilities to a persistent desktop assistant for **Windows 11** and **Ubuntu 24.04**.

### **1. Core Features & Feasibility**

The primary goal is to create a desktop sidebar that provides "screen awareness" to your AI. The assistant will be able to see the user's screen, understand the context, and even interact with other applications upon user approval.

  * **AI-Powered Text Modification:** This key feature is **achievable**. The client application will use OS-level automation libraries to simulate keyboard input. The workflow requires explicit user confirmation via a dialog box before any text is modified, ensuring security and user control.

-----

### **2. Security & Authentication Architecture**

The system will use a multi-layered security model to ensure that only authorized applications and users can access the backend.

#### **2.1. Certificate Provisioning Workflow**

A user-friendly workflow will be implemented to securely distribute the necessary mTLS certificates to new machines.

1.  **Request:** A user on an unauthenticated machine is redirected to a public "Request Access" page where they can submit their email.
2.  **Approval:** The request appears in the admin WebUI for an administrator to approve.
3.  **Notification:** Upon approval, an email is sent to the user with a time-sensitive, secure link.
4.  **Download:** The link leads to a page for downloading a platform-specific certificate package (for Windows, macOS, or Ubuntu), complete with installation instructions.

#### **2.2. Machine-to-Machine Authentication (mTLS)**

The foundational security layer authenticates the application itself. The desktop client will use the provisioned certificates to establish a secure mTLS connection to the server. The Caddy reverse proxy will reject any connection that does not present a valid client certificate.

#### **2.3. User-to-Machine Authentication (2FA & JWT)**

Once the secure channel is established, the human user must authenticate.

1.  The client sends username/password credentials to the server.
2.  The server validates them and challenges for a **Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)** code.
3.  Upon successful 2FA verification, the server issues a **JSON Web Token (JWT)**.
4.  The client includes this JWT as a Bearer Token in the header of all subsequent API requests for the session.

### **3. Project Implementation Plan (Todo Lists)**

#### **3.1. Backend API Development**

  * **☐ Implement Certificate Provisioning Logic:**

      * Create a database table to manage `access_requests`.
      * Build public API endpoints for submitting an access request (`/public/request-access`) and for downloading the certificate packages via a secure token (`/public/download-certs/{token}`).
      * Build admin API endpoints for listing and approving requests.
      * Integrate an email service to send notifications with the download link.
      * Develop the logic to dynamically package OS-specific certificates (`.pfx` for Windows, `.p12` for macOS, separate `.crt` / `.key` for Linux).

  * **☐ Implement Native Client Authentication Endpoints:**

      * Create a `/native/login` endpoint that validates username/password over mTLS.
      * Create a `/native/verify-2fa` endpoint that validates the TOTP code and returns a JWT.

  * **☐ Enhance the Analysis API for the Native Client:**

      * Create a `GET /native/modes` endpoint that returns a list of available AI chat modes (e.g., "Reflective Coach," "Coding Assistant") managed in the admin panel.
      * Modify the main analysis endpoint (`POST /native/analyze`) to accept a `multipart/form-data` payload containing an `image`, a `context` string, and an optional `mode` string to guide the LangGraph router.

#### **3.2. WebUI & Reverse Proxy Modifications**

  * **☐ Configure Caddy Reverse Proxy:** Update the `Caddyfile` to redirect clients that fail the mTLS check to the new "Request Access" page instead of showing a generic error.
  * **☐ Build Public Access Pages:** In the SvelteKit WebUI, create the public page for requesting access and the secure page for downloading certificates.
  * **☐ Update Admin Panel:** Add a new section to the admin WebUI to manage and approve certificate access requests.

#### **3.3. Desktop Client Application Development**

  * **☐ Choose Cross-Platform Strategy:**

      * **Option A (Python):** Use **Python + PyQt6**. Leverages your existing Python ecosystem and has strong native library support. Package with **PyInstaller**.
      * **Option B (Web Tech):** Use **Electron + Svelte**. Reuses your existing Svelte 5 UI components for a modern UI. Package with **Electron Forge/Builder**.

  * **☐ Implement Core Application Structure:**

      * Build the persistent, always-on-top sidebar GUI.
      * Securely bundle and manage the mTLS certificates provisioned by the new workflow.
      * Implement the full 2FA login flow to obtain and store the session JWT.

  * **☐ Implement Feature Logic:**

      * Integrate libraries for screen capture (`mss`), global input listening (`pynput`), and keyboard simulation (`pyautogui`).
      * Build the "Ambient Awareness" mode with a cooldown timer.
      * Build the "Focused Selection" mode with a transparent overlay for drawing a selection box.
      * Build the user confirmation dialog for the "Text Modification" feature.

  * **☐ Implement Mode Selection:**

      * On startup, call the `/native/modes` endpoint to fetch available AI personas.
      * Populate a dropdown menu in the sidebar with these modes.
      * Include the user's selected mode in every request to the `/native/analyze` endpoint.

  * **☐ Package for Distribution:** Create the final `.exe` (Windows) and `.deb`/`.AppImage` (Ubuntu) installers.
