## scripts/fix_permissions.sh

**Location:** `/scripts/fix_permissions.sh`  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive file permission repair for Docker-related issues.

### Description
Fixes common permission problems caused by Docker operations, including files owned by root, incorrect permissions, and access issues that prevent normal operation.

### Usage
```bash
sudo ./scripts/fix_permissions.sh
```

### What It Fixes
```bash
# Ownership Issues
- Files owned by root due to Docker operations
- Incorrect group ownership
- Mixed ownership across project files

# Permission Issues  
- Non-executable script files
- Overly restrictive directory permissions
- Incorrect file permissions (644 for files, 755 for directories)
- Secrets with insufficient security (600 for sensitive files)

# Specific Targets
- scripts/ directory and all .sh files
- docker/ configuration directory
- config/ application configuration
- app/ application source code
- logs/ directory for log files
- secrets/ directory with secure permissions (700/600)
```

### Process
```bash
# Target user determination
TARGET_USER="${SUDO_USER:-$(whoami)}"
TARGET_GROUP=$(id -gn "$TARGET_USER")

# Permission fixing process
1. Change ownership to target user:group
2. Set directory permissions to 755
3. Set file permissions to 644  
4. Make .sh scripts executable (755)
5. Secure secrets directory (700 for dir, 600 for files)
6. Fix any root-owned files
7. Restore executable permissions where needed
```

### Output
```
ðŸ”§ Fixing File Permissions
==========================
Target user: username
Target group: usergroup
Project root: /home/user/ai_workflow_engine

Fixing scripts directory...
âœ… Fixed scripts directory

Fixing docker directory...
âœ… Fixed docker directory

Setting restrictive permissions for secrets directory...
âœ… Secrets directory permissions secured

ðŸŽ¯ Permission fix complete!

You should now be able to run scripts without sudo:
  ./run.sh
  ./scripts/worker_universal_fix.sh
  ./scripts/_setup_secrets_and_certs.sh
```

### When to Use

## Common Utility Patterns

### Error Handling Pattern
```bash
# Standard error handling
set -e
trap cleanup EXIT

cleanup() {
    # Cleanup operations
    log_info "Cleaning up..."
}

# Operation with error handling
if ! operation_command; then
    log_error "Operation failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Retry Pattern
```bash
# Retry with exponential backoff
retry_with_backoff() {
    local cmd="$1"
    local max_attempts="$2"
    local delay="$3"
    
    for attempt in $(seq 1 $max_attempts); do
        if eval "$cmd"; then
            return 0
        fi
        
        if [ $attempt -lt $max_attempts ]; then
            sleep $((delay * 2**(attempt-1)))
        fi
    done
    
    return 1
}
```

### Service Health Check Pattern
```bash
# Health check with timeout
wait_for_service() {
    local service="$1"
    local timeout="${2:-120}"
    local interval="${3:-5}"
    
    for ((i=0; i<timeout; i+=interval)); do
        if docker compose ps "$service" | grep -q "healthy"; then
            return 0
        fi
        sleep $interval
    done
    
    return 1
}
```

## Best Practices

### Permission Management
1. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only grant necessary permissions
2. **Secure Secrets:** Use restrictive permissions (600/700) for sensitive files
3. **Regular Fixes:** Run permission fixes after Docker operations
4. **User Awareness:** Understand when sudo is required vs. regular user

### Service Management
1. **Dependency Awareness:** Start services in correct dependency order
2. **Health Validation:** Always validate service health after startup
3. **Retry Logic:** Implement appropriate retry mechanisms
4. **Resource Management:** Monitor and manage resource usage

### Development Efficiency
1. **Selective Restarts:** Only restart services that need updates
2. **Development Modes:** Use development-specific optimizations
3. **Quick Diagnostics:** Use targeted diagnostic tools
4. **Automation:** Automate repetitive maintenance tasks

### Maintenance Strategy
1. **Proactive Fixes:** Address issues before they become problems
2. **Regular Updates:** Keep systems and dependencies updated
3. **Monitoring Integration:** Integrate utilities with monitoring systems
4. **Documentation:** Document utility usage and troubleshooting steps
