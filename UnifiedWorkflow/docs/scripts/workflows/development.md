# Development Workflow Scripts

This guide covers the essential scripts and workflows for daily development tasks in the AI Workflow Engine project.

## üöÄ Quick Start Development Workflow

### Initial Setup (First Time)
```bash
# 1. Clone and enter project
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai_workflow_engine

# 2. Fix permissions and make scripts executable
sudo ./scripts/fix_permissions.sh
./scripts/_make_scripts_executable.sh

# 3. Complete initial setup
./scripts/_setup.sh

# 4. Start the application
./run.sh
```

### Daily Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Start development environment (preserves data)
./run.sh --soft-reset

# 2. Make your code changes
# Edit files in app/, docker/, config/, etc.

# 3. Generate migration if needed
./scripts/_generate_migration.sh "Add new feature"

# 4. Test changes
# Access application at https://localhost:8080

# 5. Fix any permission issues
sudo ./scripts/fix_permissions.sh  # If needed
```

## üîÑ Development Reset Options

### Soft Reset (Recommended for Development)
**Use when:** Code changes, dependency updates, configuration changes
**Preserves:** User data, AI models, certificates, chat history
**Removes:** Application containers, build cache

```bash
./run.sh --soft-reset
```

**What it preserves:**
- ‚úÖ User accounts and authentication
- ‚úÖ Chat history and conversations
- ‚úÖ AI model downloads (several GB)
- ‚úÖ Vector embeddings (Qdrant data)
- ‚úÖ SSL certificates and secrets
- ‚úÖ Session data and login tokens

**What it resets:**
- ‚ùå Application containers (rebuilt)
- ‚ùå Monitoring data (Prometheus/Grafana)
- ‚ùå Temporary build artifacts

### Full Reset (Use with Caution)
**Use when:** Major structural changes, database schema changes, corrupted data
**Removes:** Everything including user data and AI models

```bash
./run.sh --reset
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This removes ALL data including user accounts and AI models.

### Build Only (Quick Updates)
**Use when:** Minor code changes, UI updates
**Preserves:** All data and running state
**Updates:** Docker images only

```bash
./run.sh --build
```

## üéØ Development Best Practices

### Efficient Development Loop
1. **Use Soft Reset:** Preserves data while updating code
2. **Monitor Logs:** Keep logs open to catch issues early
3. **Validate Changes:** Use health checks after modifications
4. **Fix Permissions:** Run permission fixes when needed
5. **Test Early:** Run tests frequently during development

### Resource Management
1. **Docker Cleanup:** Regular `docker system prune` to free space
2. **Log Rotation:** Logs are automatically rotated
3. **Model Management:** Only download needed AI models
4. **Certificate Management:** Use development certificates for speed

### Security During Development
1. **Certificate Validation:** Regular SSL validation
2. **Security Monitoring:** Monitor security events
3. **Access Control:** Use proper authentication even in development
4. **Secrets Management:** Never commit secrets to git

### Performance Considerations
1. **Build Cache:** Use Docker build cache when possible
2. **Service Optimization:** Only restart services that changed
3. **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor container resource usage
4. **Database Optimization:** Keep database healthy
