## üìã Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies
- Minimum 4GB RAM for monitoring services
- 10GB disk space for metrics storage

### Dependencies

```bash
# Python packages (already in pyproject.toml)
prometheus-client
numpy
redis
aiofiles
```

### Network Requirements

- Port 9090: Prometheus
- Port 9093: AlertManager
- Port 3000: Grafana
- Port 8000: API (security endpoints)
- Port 9091: Security metrics (internal)

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Validation

Run the validation script to ensure all components are properly configured:

```bash
./scripts/validate_security_monitoring.sh
```

This script validates:
- Docker Compose configuration
- Security service files
- Configuration file integrity
- Python dependencies
- Service integration
- Dashboard structure

### 2. Configuration Setup

#### AlertManager Configuration

The AlertManager is configured with multi-tier routing:

```yaml
# config/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml
route:
  group_by: ['alertname', 'severity']
  group_wait: 30s
  group_interval: 5m
  repeat_interval: 1h
  receiver: 'security-team'
  
  routes:
    - match:
        severity: critical
      receiver: 'security-critical'
      group_wait: 10s
      repeat_interval: 5m
```

#### Prometheus Security Rules

Security alerting rules are defined in:
- `config/prometheus/security_rules.yml`

#### Grafana Dashboards

Pre-configured dashboards:
- Security Overview: `/security/security-overview`
- Authentication Dashboard: `/security/authentication-dashboard`
- Threat Detection: `/security/threat-detection-dashboard`
- System Health: `/system/system-health-dashboard`

### 3. Service Deployment

#### Standard Deployment

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Verify services are running
docker-compose ps

# Check service logs
docker-compose logs -f alertmanager
docker-compose logs -f api
```

#### mTLS Deployment (Production)

```bash
# Deploy with mTLS security
docker-compose -f docker-compose-mtls.yml up -d

# Verify certificate setup
docker-compose -f docker-compose-mtls.yml logs alertmanager | grep -i certificate
```

### 4. Service Startup Verification

The security services are automatically started with the API:

```bash
# Check API logs for security service initialization
docker-compose logs api | grep -i "security monitoring"

# Expected output:
# Initializing security monitoring services...
# Security monitoring services initialized successfully.
```

### 5. Endpoint Testing

#### Health Check

```bash
# Check overall security monitoring health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/security/health

# Expected response:
{
  "overall_status": "healthy",
  "components": {
    "security_metrics_service": {"status": "running"},
    "security_event_processor": {"status": "running"},
    "automated_response_service": {"status": "running"}
  }
}
```

#### Metrics Endpoint

```bash
# Verify Prometheus metrics
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/security/metrics

# Should return Prometheus format metrics
```

#### Dashboard Access

- Grafana: http://localhost:3000
- AlertManager: http://localhost:9093
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090

## üîß Configuration Customization

### Alert Routing

Customize alert routing in `config/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml`:

```yaml
receivers:
  - name: 'security-team'
    email_configs:
      - to: 'your-security-team@company.com'
        subject: '[SECURITY] {{ .GroupLabels.alertname }}'
```

### Detection Thresholds

Modify threat detection thresholds in the threat detection service:

```python
# app/shared/services/threat_detection_service.py
self.threat_rules = {
    ThreatType.BRUTE_FORCE: {
        'auth_failure_rate': 10,  # failures per minute
        'auth_failure_burst': 20,  # failures in 5 minutes
    }
}
```

### Security Response Actions

Configure automated response actions:

```python
# app/shared/services/automated_security_response_service.py
self.threat_thresholds = {
    'auth_failure_rate': 5,      # failures per minute
    'violation_rate': 3,         # violations per minute
    'anomaly_score': 0.8,        # anomaly detection threshold
}
```

## üìä Monitoring and Alerting

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service Startup Failures**
   ```bash
   # Check service logs
   docker-compose logs api | grep -i error
   
   # Verify Redis connectivity
   docker-compose exec api python -c "import redis; r=redis.Redis(host='redis'); print(r.ping())"
   ```

2. **Missing Metrics**
   ```bash
   # Check Prometheus target health
   curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets
   
   # Verify security metrics endpoint
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/security/metrics
   ```

3. **Alert Delivery Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check AlertManager configuration
   curl http://localhost:9093/api/v1/status
   
   # Verify SMTP settings
   docker-compose logs alertmanager | grep -i smtp
   ```

### Log Analysis

Key log patterns to monitor:

```bash
# Security service initialization
grep "Security monitoring services initialized" logs/api.log

# Threat detections
grep "THREAT DETECTED" logs/api.log

# Automated responses
grep "Security action.*executed" logs/api.log

# System health issues
grep "Security monitoring status.*degraded" logs/api.log
```
