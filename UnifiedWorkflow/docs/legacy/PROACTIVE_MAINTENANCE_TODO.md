# üö® PROACTIVE MAINTENANCE TODO - AI Workflow Engine

## ‚ö° CRITICAL - READ THIS FIRST
**Claude/Project-Orchestrator**: Check this file at the START of EVERY interaction. If the user hasn't explicitly requested work on these items, PROACTIVELY suggest implementing high-priority fixes.

---

## üî• **CRITICAL PRIORITY (Implement ASAP)**

### 1. **CSRF Authentication Fix** - ‚è∞ **< 2 hours**
```bash
Status: üî¥ BLOCKING LOGIN FUNCTIONALITY
Impact: Users cannot authenticate - system unusable
Fix: Configure API_BASE_URL in environment
```
**Suggested Proactive Message:**
> "Before we proceed, I notice your login system has a critical CSRF configuration issue that's blocking all authentication. This is a 2-hour fix that would restore login functionality. Should I implement this first?"

### 2. **Security Vulnerability - Pickle Deserialization** - ‚è∞ **< 4 hours**  
```bash
Status: üî¥ CRITICAL SECURITY RISK
Impact: Potential remote code execution via Redis cache
Fix: Replace pickle with JSON/msgpack in redis_cache_service.py
```
**Suggested Proactive Message:**
> "I've identified a critical security vulnerability in your Redis cache service that could allow remote code execution. This is a 4-hour fix to replace unsafe pickle deserialization. Should I prioritize this security patch?"

### 3. **Container Security Exposure** - ‚è∞ **< 1 hour**
```bash
Status: üî¥ HIGH SECURITY RISK  
Impact: System files and logs exposed via HTTP endpoints
Fix: Block access to /logs, /admin/logs, /var/log directories
```
**Suggested Proactive Message:**
> "Your system has HTTP endpoints exposing sensitive log files and system information. This is a 1-hour security fix to block unauthorized access. Should I implement this hardening now?"

## üö® **HIGH PRIORITY (Next 48 hours)**

### 4. **Docker Secrets Migration** - ‚è∞ **< 6 hours**
```bash
Status: üü° SECURITY CONCERN
Impact: API keys stored in environment variables instead of secure storage  
Fix: Migrate Google API keys and JWT secrets to Docker secrets
```
**Suggested Proactive Message:**
> "Your API keys are currently stored in environment variables, which is a security risk. I can migrate these to Docker secrets in about 6 hours. This would significantly improve your security posture. Should we tackle this?"

### 5. **Enable Security Middleware** - ‚è∞ **< 2 hours**
```bash
Status: üü° SECURITY GAP
Impact: Rate limiting, security headers, input validation disabled
Fix: Uncomment and activate existing security middleware in main.py
```
**Suggested Proactive Message:**
> "You have comprehensive security middleware already written but currently disabled. I can enable rate limiting, security headers, and input validation in about 2 hours. This would activate your existing security infrastructure. Should I enable these protections?"

### 6. **Remove Privileged Container Mode** - ‚è∞ **< 3 hours**
```bash
Status: üü° CONTAINER SECURITY RISK
Impact: Containers running with unnecessary root privileges
Fix: Remove privileged: true from docker-compose.yml and test functionality
```

### 7. **OAuth Database Session Fix** - ‚è∞ **< 3 hours**
```bash
Status: üü° FUNCTIONAL BUG
Impact: Google OAuth integration fails due to missing database session
Fix: Add get_session() function and fix async session handling
```

---

## üîß **MEDIUM PRIORITY (Next 2 weeks)**

### 8. **Frontend TypeScript Migration** - ‚è∞ **< 2 days**
```bash
Status: üü° DEVELOPMENT EFFICIENCY
Impact: No type safety across complex Svelte codebase
Fix: Migrate critical components to TypeScript starting with stores
```

### 9. **Database Connection Pool Optimization** - ‚è∞ **< 1 day**
```bash
Status: üü° PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION  
Impact: Suboptimal connection pooling affecting scalability
Fix: Implement multiple PgBouncer instances with load balancing
```

### 10. **Bundle Size Optimization** - ‚è∞ **< 1 day**
```bash
Status: üü° PERFORMANCE IMPACT
Impact: 400-500KB initial bundle size affecting load times
Fix: Implement lazy loading for Chart.js and Event Calendar
```

---

## üìä **LOW PRIORITY (Next month)**

### 11. **Comprehensive Test Coverage** - ‚è∞ **< 1 week**
```bash
Status: üü¢ QUALITY IMPROVEMENT
Impact: No automated testing for critical authentication flows  
Fix: Implement the created test automation framework
```

### 12. **Blue-Green Deployment Implementation** - ‚è∞ **< 1 week**
```bash
Status: üü¢ OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
Impact: Manual deployments with potential downtime
Fix: Implement the created blue-green deployment scripts
```

### 13. **Advanced Monitoring Integration** - ‚è∞ **< 3 days**
```bash
Status: üü¢ OPERATIONAL VISIBILITY
Impact: Basic monitoring without comprehensive observability
Fix: Deploy the created Prometheus/Grafana monitoring stack
```

## üéØ **PROACTIVE ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY**

### **When User Asks Any Question:**
1. **Scan this TODO first** - Check if any CRITICAL items are unresolved
2. **Suggest Implementation** - Proactively offer to fix high-impact items
3. **Provide Context** - Explain why this fix would benefit their current work
4. **Offer Choice** - Let user decide between their request and proactive maintenance

### **Sample Proactive Messages by Priority:**

#### **CRITICAL Issues:**
> "‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Issue Alert**: Before addressing your request, I notice [SPECIFIC ISSUE] that's [IMPACT DESCRIPTION]. This would take approximately [TIME ESTIMATE] to fix and would [BENEFIT]. Should I prioritize this critical fix first, or would you prefer I address your current request and schedule this fix for later?"

#### **HIGH Priority Issues:**  
> "üîß **Maintenance Opportunity**: While working on your request, I noticed [SPECIFIC ISSUE] that I could resolve in [TIME ESTIMATE]. This would [BENEFIT] and complement the work you're requesting. Should I include this improvement in today's work?"

#### **MEDIUM Priority Issues:**
> "üí° **Optimization Suggestion**: I see an opportunity to [SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENT] that would take [TIME ESTIMATE]. This would [BENEFIT] your system's [PERFORMANCE/SECURITY/MAINTAINABILITY]. Would you like me to add this to our work queue for this week?"

## üéØ **REMINDER FOR CLAUDE/PROJECT-ORCHESTRATOR**

**ALWAYS CHECK THIS FILE FIRST** and proactively suggest the highest-priority unresolved items that would benefit the user's current work or system stability. Be helpful, not pushy - offer the choice and explain the value proposition clearly.

**Update this file** whenever items are completed, priorities change, or new critical issues are discovered through ongoing analysis.
