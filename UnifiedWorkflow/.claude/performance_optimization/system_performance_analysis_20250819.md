## Critical Performance Issues Identified

### 1. API Container Failure (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** API container failing to start due to missing cryptography dependencies
**Impact:** Complete service disruption for authentication and core API functionality
**Root Cause:** Missing cryptography Python package in container image
**Symptoms:**
- Container exits immediately on startup
- Authentication endpoints returning 401 errors
- WebUI unable to authenticate users

### 2. GPU Underutilization (HIGH)
**Issue:** GPU utilization at 0.0% despite 3x GPUs available
**Impact:** Significant performance potential wasted, increased operational costs
**Current Configuration:**
- GPU Memory Utilization: 0.057% (7MB/12288MB per GPU)
- Active Models: 9 loaded but inactive
- Inference Performance: 2.38s average (suboptimal)

**Root Causes:**
- OLLAMA service not actively processing requests
- GPU-accelerated services not receiving workload
- Potential configuration issues preventing GPU access

### 3. Database Configuration Suboptimal (MEDIUM)
**Issue:** PostgreSQL shared_buffers set to 16384 (16KB) vs configured 256MB
**Impact:** Poor query performance and memory utilization
**Current State:**
- Shared buffers: 16KB (should be 256MB)
- Only 1 table in primary database (users table)
- Minimal database activity detected
