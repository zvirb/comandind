## üìã AGENT COORDINATION STRATEGY

### Critical Priority Execution Path:

#### Phase 2 Requirements:
1. **Immediate Actions** (deployment-orchestrator + infrastructure-orchestrator):
   - Fix health-monitor metrics endpoint error
   - Rebuild health-monitor container
   - Investigate perception-service failures
   - Execute container rebuild automation

2. **Validation Requirements** (production-endpoint-validator + monitoring-analyst):
   - Verify health-monitor recovery with evidence
   - Confirm perception-service restoration
   - Validate all monitoring endpoints functional
   - Provide concrete proof (curl outputs, logs)

3. **Quality Assurance** (backend-gateway-expert + user-experience-auditor):
   - Test API endpoints thoroughly
   - Validate user workflows functioning
   - Confirm infrastructure stability

### Tool Access Validation:
- ‚úÖ Bash: Available for all container operations
- ‚úÖ Docker commands: Accessible via Bash tool
- ‚úÖ File operations: Read/Edit/Write tools functional
- ‚úÖ Monitoring: Can access logs and metrics
- ‚úÖ Evidence collection: Screenshot and curl capabilities ready

## üéØ PHASE 2 READINESS ASSESSMENT

### Infrastructure Recovery Readiness: ‚úÖ READY

**Strengths:**
1. All critical infrastructure agents available and validated
2. Recovery automation scripts ready for execution
3. Python imports validated - no blocking issues
4. Container management tools accessible
5. Evidence-based validation framework ready

**Immediate Priorities for Phase 2:**
1. Fix health-monitor ValueError (1 line code fix)
2. Execute health-monitor container rebuild
3. Diagnose perception-service issues
4. Implement automated recovery activation
5. Validate all fixes with concrete evidence

**Agent Deployment Strategy:**
- Deploy infrastructure-orchestrator for container management
- Deploy deployment-orchestrator for rebuild automation
- Deploy backend-gateway-expert for service validation
- Deploy monitoring-analyst for health verification
- Deploy production-endpoint-validator for end-to-end testing
