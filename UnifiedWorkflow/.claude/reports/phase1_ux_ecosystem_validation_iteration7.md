- ‚ùå 3 critical API endpoints non-functional (/chat/, /documents/, /calendar/)
- ‚ùå Memory service database connection issues affecting data persistence
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure foundation stable (100% container health achieved)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Access Validation

### Browser Automation ‚úÖ
```
Playwright Status: INSTALLED AND READY
Current Tab: https://aiwfe.com/ (Production site accessible)
Capability: Full browser interaction for user workflow testing
```

### API Testing ‚úÖ
```
curl: Available
WebSocket debugging: Available via fullstack-communication-auditor
Network monitoring: Available
```

### Container Management ‚úÖ
```
Docker access: Confirmed
Container health monitoring: Active
Service logs access: Available
```

---

## üìä Current System Health

### Infrastructure Status: 100% HEALTHY ‚úÖ
```
Total Containers: 19
Healthy: 19 (100%)
Unhealthy: 0
Critical Services: ALL OPERATIONAL
```

### Confirmed API Issues (Evidence-Based)
```bash
/api/v1/chat/     : 405 Method Not Allowed (GET not supported, likely needs POST)
/api/v1/documents/: 401 Unauthorized (Authentication required)
/api/v1/calendar/ : 404 Not Found (Endpoint doesn't exist)
```

### WebSocket Issues Confirmed
```
- Chat system WebSocket authentication failures detected in logs
- Model loading issues: qwen2.5:1.5b returning 404
- WebSocket connection blocked preventing real-time communication
```

## üîÑ Agent Coordination Strategy for UX Restoration

### Phase 2 Strategic Planning Requirements
1. **Chat System Restoration Team**
   - Lead: fullstack-communication-auditor (WebSocket debugging)
   - Support: backend-gateway-expert (API fixes)
   - Validation: user-experience-auditor (real user testing)

2. **Authentication Fix Team**
   - Lead: security-validator (secure session management)
   - Support: frictionless-ux-architect (user flow optimization)
   - Frontend: webui-architect (UI integration)

3. **API Endpoint Restoration**
   - Lead: backend-gateway-expert (endpoint implementation)
   - Validation: fullstack-communication-auditor (contract validation)
   - Testing: user-experience-auditor (user perspective validation)

---

## üìã Evidence Collection Requirements

### For Chat System Fix
- WebSocket connection logs before/after
- Authentication token validation evidence
- Real-time message flow demonstration
- User interaction screenshots showing working chat

### For Authentication Restoration
- Session persistence across features
- Login/logout flow validation
- Token refresh mechanism evidence
- No unexpected logouts during navigation

### For API Endpoints
- curl outputs showing successful responses
- Proper HTTP status codes (200/201)
- Data retrieval/submission evidence
- Integration with frontend components

---

## üöÄ Readiness Assessment for Phase 2

### ‚úÖ Ready for Strategic UX Planning
- All necessary agents available and validated
- Tool access confirmed (browser automation, API testing, WebSocket debugging)
- Infrastructure foundation stable (100% health maintained)
- Clear understanding of UX issues from evidence
- Agent coordination patterns established

### Recommended Phase 2 Priorities
1. **CRITICAL**: Fix chat WebSocket authentication (blocks core feature)
2. **HIGH**: Restore authentication/session management (affects all features)
3. **HIGH**: Implement missing API endpoints (/documents/, /calendar/)
4. **MEDIUM**: Fix memory service database connection
5. **MAINTAIN**: Keep 100% infrastructure health during fixes
