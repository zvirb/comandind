- **6 Recording Rules** for efficient dashboard queries:
  - Success/failure rates (5min windows)
  - JWT validation success rates
  - Response time percentiles (50th, 95th)
  - Cache hit rates (10min windows)

### 5. Grafana Dashboard
**File**: `config/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/security/auth-monitoring-dashboard.json`

  - JWT operation rate monitoring
  - SECRET_KEY and Bearer token health status
  - Cache performance and active session counts
  - Failure reason breakdown and anomaly tracking
  - WebSocket authentication status

### 6. Authentication Health API
**File**: `app/api/routers/auth_health_router.py`

- **6 Endpoints** for programmatic health monitoring:
  - `/auth/health/status` - Overall system health
  - `/auth/health/metrics` - Detailed metrics (admin only)
  - `/auth/health/bearer-token/consistency` - Bearer token status
  - `/auth/health/jwt/validation-stats` - JWT statistics
  - `/auth/health/performance-targets` - Target compliance
  - `/auth/health/cache/clear` - Cache management (admin only)

### 7. Enhanced Performance Middleware Integration
**File**: `app/api/middleware/auth_performance_middleware.py`

- **Cache Monitoring**: Integrated cache hit/miss recording
- **Performance Tracking**: Response time measurement and target compliance
