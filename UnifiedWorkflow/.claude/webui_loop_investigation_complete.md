# WebUI Looping Investigation - COMPLETE ✅

## Investigation Summary
**Date**: 2025-08-19  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Root Cause**: Docker health check cascading failures causing WebUI container restarts  

## Critical Findings

### 1. **PRIMARY ROOT CAUSE: Container Health Check Failures**
- **WebUI Container Death**: The WebUI container was being killed by Docker's health check system
- **DNS Resolution Failure**: When WebUI died, Caddy couldn't resolve `webui:3001` causing DNS errors
- **Health Check Aggressiveness**: 30-second intervals with short timeouts caused restart loops
- **Dependency Chain**: WebUI depends on API health, creating cascading failures

### 2. **Container Events Analysis**
```
PATTERN IDENTIFIED:
1. Health check fails after 30 seconds
2. Docker sends SIGKILL (signal 9) to WebUI container  
3. Container status shows "exited" and "unhealthy"
4. Caddy gets "dial tcp: lookup webui on 127.0.0.11:53: server misbehaving"
5. Loop continues with container restarts
```

### 3. **Infrastructure Loop Detection**
- ❌ Browser caching issues: Not the cause
- ❌ Caddy reverse proxy loops: Routing worked correctly when WebUI was up  
- ❌ WebSocket connection loops: Not relevant to the container death issue
- ✅ **Container health check loops**: CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE
- ❌ React development mode: Not causing container failures
- ❌ CSS/WebGL animations: Not impacting container health
- ❌ Memory leaks: Not the primary issue
- ❌ Browser extensions: Client-side, not affecting containers
- ❌ Network connectivity: DNS worked when containers were healthy
- ❌ Asset loading: Not causing health check failures
- ❌ Environment variables: Configuration was correct

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced WebUI Health Check Configuration**
```yaml
webui:
  healthcheck:
    test:
      - CMD-SHELL
      - wget --quiet --tries=2 --spider --timeout=10 http://0.0.0.0:3001/ || exit 1
    interval: 45s      # Increased from 30s
    timeout: 15s       # Increased from 10s  
    retries: 5         # Increased from 3
    start_period: 60s  # Increased from 30s
```

### 2. **Enhanced API Health Check Configuration**  
```yaml
api:
  healthcheck:
    test:
      - CMD-SHELL
      - curl -f http://localhost:8000/health --max-time 10 || exit 1
    interval: 45s      # Increased from 30s
    timeout: 15s       # Increased from 10s
    retries: 4         # Increased from 3
    start_period: 45s  # Increased from 30s
```

### 3. **Resource Allocation Optimization**
```yaml
webui:
  deploy:
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 512M
      reservations:
        memory: 256M
```

## Validation Results

### ✅ **Production Endpoints**
- `http://aiwfe.com` → 308 redirect to HTTPS (correct)
- `https://aiwfe.com` → 200 OK (working)  
- Container status: healthy and stable
- No DNS resolution errors in Caddy logs

### ✅ **Container Health Status**
- WebUI: healthy
- API: healthy  
- All dependencies: stable
- No restart loops detected

### ✅ **Infrastructure Monitoring**
- Health check intervals: optimized to 45s
- Timeout periods: increased for stability
- Retry counts: increased for resilience  
- Start periods: extended for proper initialization

## Technical Analysis

### **Why This Solution Works**
1. **Reduced Health Check Aggressiveness**: 45-second intervals prevent false positives during high load
2. **Increased Timeouts**: 15-second timeouts accommodate temporary slowdowns
3. **More Retries**: 5 retries for WebUI, 4 for API provide better fault tolerance
4. **Extended Start Period**: 60s for WebUI allows proper Next.js initialization

### **Prevention Measures**
1. **Resource Limits**: Memory limits prevent OOM kills
2. **Dependency Management**: Proper health check sequencing  
3. **Monitoring**: Enhanced logging for future troubleshooting
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Better health check resilience

## Evidence of Resolution

### **Before Fix**
```
caddy_reverse_proxy-1 | "error":"dial tcp: lookup webui on 127.0.0.11:53: server misbehaving"
Container events: Multiple SIGKILL signals to WebUI
Status: Container exited/unhealthy repeatedly
```

### **After Fix**  
```
Container Status: Up and healthy
Production HTTPS: 200 OK responses
Caddy Logs: Normal upstream routing
No DNS resolution errors
```

## Conclusion

**ROOT CAUSE**: Aggressive Docker health check configurations causing container restart loops, not authentication throttling or frontend issues.

**SOLUTION**: Optimized health check intervals, timeouts, and retry counts for both API and WebUI services.

**RESULT**: Stable WebUI operation with no looping behavior on production endpoints.

The infrastructure orchestration successfully identified and resolved the actual infrastructure-level issue that was masquerading as a frontend problem.
