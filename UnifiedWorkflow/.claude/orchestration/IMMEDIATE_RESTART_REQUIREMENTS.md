# üö® IMMEDIATE ORCHESTRATION RESTART REQUIREMENTS

## CRITICAL FINDING
**The session management crisis is an INTEGRATION problem, not an implementation problem.**

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
- ‚úÖ Backend implementation: GOOD (UnifiedSessionManager, connection pools)
- ‚úÖ Frontend implementation: GOOD (Session recovery, WebSocket persistence)  
- ‚úÖ Security implementation: GOOD (JWT rotation, CSRF hardening)
- ‚ùå Integration between services: FAILED (No cross-service coordination)

## WHY RESTART IS REQUIRED
1. **Wrong Problem Solved**: Fixed individual domains but not their integration
2. **Critical Issue Persists**: Documents/Calendar still cause logout (Phase 0 issue)
3. **Success Rate**: Only 65% achieved when 95% is achievable with integration focus

## RESTART REQUIREMENTS - PHASE 0

### 1. Define Success Explicitly
```yaml
success_criteria:
  primary: "User can navigate to Documents WITHOUT logout"
  secondary: "User can navigate to Calendar WITHOUT logout"  
  tertiary: "Session persists across ALL features"
  evidence: "Playwright screenshots of successful navigation"
```

### 2. Integration Context Creation
Create new context showing:
- How session flows from login through all services
- Where Redis, JWT, and AuthContext must synchronize
- Integration points between backend/frontend/security

### 3. New Role Assignment
```yaml
session-integration-coordinator:
  responsibility: "Own end-to-end session flow across services"
  authority: "Validate cross-service integration"
  deliverable: "Working session across all features"
```

## PHASE-BY-PHASE CORRECTIONS

### Phase 0-1: Todo Integration
- Focus on session-persistence-validation-20250816
- Include all related session todos as connected issues

### Phase 2-3: Strategic Research  
- Map COMPLETE session architecture
- Identify ALL integration points
- Document session flow across services

### Phase 4: Context Synthesis
**CRITICAL ADDITION**: Create "Integration Context Package"
- Session architecture diagram
- Cross-service dependencies
- Integration validation requirements
- Share with ALL specialists

### Phase 5: Implementation with Checkpoints
**NEW STRUCTURE**:
```yaml
execution_pattern:
  0-25%: Individual domain implementation
  25%: INTEGRATION CHECKPOINT #1
  25-75%: Coordinated implementation
  75%: INTEGRATION CHECKPOINT #2  
  75-100%: Integration validation
  100%: End-to-end testing
```

### Phase 6: User Journey Validation
**MANDATORY TESTS**:
1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to Documents (MUST NOT logout)
3. Navigate to Calendar (MUST NOT logout)
4. Navigate back to Chat (session preserved)
5. Provide Playwright screenshots as evidence

### Phase 7: Decision Point
- Only proceed if ALL user journeys work
- If any logout occurs, return to Phase 5 with integration focus

### Phase 8-10: Complete and Learn
- Document integration patterns
- Update orchestration rules
- Feed back learnings

## SPECIFIC FIXES NEEDED

### 1. Session Synchronization
```python
# Backend: Ensure Redis session created on login
# Frontend: Ensure AuthContext reads Redis session
# Security: Ensure JWT validated against Redis
# Integration: All three must agree on session state
```

### 2. Navigation State Management
```javascript
// Frontend: Preserve auth state during navigation
// Backend: Validate session on route change
// Redis: Maintain session across page loads
```

### 3. Cross-Service Validation
```yaml
validation_points:
  - Login creates consistent session across all services
  - Navigation maintains session consistency
  - Feature access validates against unified session
```

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Minimum Acceptable
- Documents navigation without logout
- Calendar navigation without logout
- 85% endpoint success rate

### Target Success
- All features accessible without session loss
- 95% endpoint success rate
- <2 second session validation

## TIMELINE
- Restart: IMMEDIATE
- Estimated completion: 2-3 hours with integration focus
- Validation: 30 minutes for user journey testing

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL
**95% confidence** - The problem is now clearly understood. Integration coordination will solve it.
