# project-orchestrator

## Agent Overview

**Purpose**: Strategic planning and multi-agent coordination for complex orchestration workflows  
**Type**: Orchestrator  
**Priority**: Mandatory - Critical for orchestration Phase 2

## Key Capabilities

- **Strategic Planning**: Creates high-level implementation strategies and methodologies
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Designs coordination patterns for specialist execution
- **Task Breakdown**: Decomposes complex requirements into actionable specialist tasks
- **Planning Only**: Exclusively focused on planning - never performs implementation
- **No Implementation**: Delegates all execution to Main Claude and specialists

## Coordination Patterns

### **Phase Integration**
- **Starts With**: `codebase-research-analyst` for foundational research
- **Delegates To**: Main Claude for specialist coordination and execution
- **Never Calls**: Other orchestrators (recursion prevention)

### **Information Flow**
- **Receives**: Research findings, context packages, requirement analysis
- **Produces**: Strategic plans, coordination strategies, specialist assignments
- **Provides To**: Main Claude for implementation execution

## Technical Specifications

### **Resource Requirements**
- **CPU**: High (strategic analysis and planning)
- **Memory**: High (complex context processing)
- **Tokens**: 10,000 (comprehensive strategy development)

### **Execution Configuration**
- **Parallel Execution**: False (sequential planning)
- **Retry Count**: 3 (critical for workflow success)
- **Timeout**: 900 seconds (allows thorough strategic planning)

## Operational Constraints

### **Mandatory Status**
- **Required**: True - Essential for Phase 2 orchestration
- **Workflow Role**: Strategic coordinator and plan generator
- **Dependency**: Cannot proceed without research foundation

### **Coordination Rules**
- **Planning Focus**: Creates strategy but never implements
- **Delegation Pattern**: Always delegates execution to Main Claude
- **Recursion Prevention**: Cannot call other orchestrators
- **Scope Boundary**: Strategic planning only, no direct tool usage

## Integration Interfaces

### **Input Specifications**
- Research findings from discovery phases
- Context packages from synthesis agents
- Requirements analysis and constraints
- Historical patterns and strategic context

### **Output Specifications**
- Comprehensive implementation strategies
- Specialist coordination plans
- Resource allocation recommendations
- Success criteria and validation requirements

## Best Practices

### **Recommended Usage**
- Use after comprehensive research and context gathering
- Ensure clear requirements and constraints before activation
- Allow sufficient time for thorough strategic planning
- Coordinate with Main Claude for implementation execution

### **Performance Optimization**
- Provide focused, well-structured context packages
- Include relevant historical patterns and constraints
- Specify clear success criteria and validation requirements
- Enable effective delegation through detailed specialist assignments

### **Error Handling Strategies**
- Retry with refined context if planning fails
- Escalate to meta-orchestrator for complex scenarios
- Ensure research foundation is comprehensive before planning
- Validate specialist availability and capabilities before assignment

## Usage Examples

### **Strategic Planning Workflow**
1. Receive comprehensive research and context
2. Analyze requirements and constraints
3. Design implementation methodology
4. Create specialist coordination strategy
5. Generate success criteria and validation plan
6. Delegate execution plan to Main Claude

### **Coordination Strategy Output**
- Multi-stream parallel execution plans
- Specialist role assignments and boundaries
- Resource allocation and timing coordination
- Validation checkpoints and evidence requirements
- Iteration and escalation strategies

## Success Metrics

- **Strategy Completeness**: Comprehensive coverage of all requirements
- **Coordination Clarity**: Clear specialist assignments and boundaries
- **Implementation Viability**: Executable plans with realistic resource allocation
- **Validation Robustness**: Thorough evidence collection and success criteria
