Task Tool Parallel Validation Script

This script demonstrates that multiple Task tool calls can be executed
simultaneously in a single message, providing concrete evidence of
parallel execution functionality.

This simulates exactly what happens in the orchestration system when
Phase 5 executes multiple agents in parallel.
