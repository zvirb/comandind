Real-World Parallel Execution Demonstration

This script demonstrates multiple Task tool calls executing simultaneously
in a single message, simulating how the orchestration system would actually
use parallel execution in production.

Evidence to Collect:
1. Multiple Task calls initiated simultaneously
2. Timing analysis showing parallel vs sequential execution
3. Resource coordination during concurrent operations
4. Agent instance tracking and management
