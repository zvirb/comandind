## Risk Mitigation Framework

### Critical Risks & Mitigations

#### 1. Authentication Dependency Chain
**Risk**: K8s deployment blocked by auth issues  
**Mitigation**:
- Deploy Keycloak in parallel environment first
- Implement adapter pattern for gradual migration
- Maintain session-based fallback for 30 days
- Daily validation with production-endpoint-validator

#### 2. Service Consolidation Complexity
**Risk**: Data loss or service disruption during consolidation  
**Mitigation**:
- Blue-green deployments for each service
- Data replication during transition period
- Automated rollback on metric degradation
- Canary testing with 5% traffic initially

#### 3. WebSocket Architecture Scale
**Risk**: Real-time features fail under load  
**Mitigation**:
- Redis Cluster with 3 masters, 3 replicas
- WebSocket connection pooling
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation
- Horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA)

#### 4. User Experience Disruption
**Risk**: UI changes confuse existing users  
**Mitigation**:
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- In-app guidance and tooltips
- A/B testing with user feedback loops
- Rollback capability per feature
