# Proactive Nudges: Intelligent Contextual Assistance System

## Overview
The Proactive Nudges system is an advanced, persona-adaptive intelligent assistance platform designed to provide contextually relevant, timely, and personalized guidance across multiple user personas.

## Core Design Principles
1. **Contextual Intelligence**: Understand user context deeply
2. **Adaptive Personalization**: Customize nudges to individual needs
3. **Non-Intrusive Support**: Provide helpful guidance without overwhelming
4. **Continuous Learning**: Improve nudging effectiveness through user feedback

## Persona Classification System

### Persona Detection Mechanism
- Multi-dimensional user profiling
- Behavior pattern recognition
- Context-based classification
- Machine learning adaptive classification

### Supported Personas
1. **Academic Persona** (e.g., Chloe the Student)
2. **Professional Persona** (e.g., Alex the Freelance Consultant)
3. **Fitness Persona** (e.g., Maria the Fitness Enthusiast)
4. **Family Management Persona** (e.g., David the Busy Parent)
