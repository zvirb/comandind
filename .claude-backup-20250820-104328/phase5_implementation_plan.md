Team 2 - Validation (HIGH):
  - production-endpoint-validator: Production testing
  - user-experience-auditor: UX validation
  - fullstack-communication-auditor: API validation
  
Team 3 - Optimization (MEDIUM):

## Risk Mitigation

### Deployment Risks
- **Service Restart Failure**: Manual fallback procedures ready
- **False Positives**: Multi-point validation implemented
- **Rollback Issues**: Checkpoint-based recovery available

### Validation Risks
- **Environment Divergence**: Production mirroring enforced
- **False Negatives**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Evidence Loss**: Redundant storage implemented

### Coordination Risks
- **Agent Deadlock**: Timeout-based recovery
- **Resource Starvation**: Priority allocation active
- **Communication Failures**: Retry with exponential backoff
