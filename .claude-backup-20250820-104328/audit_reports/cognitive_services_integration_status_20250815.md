## 4. Integration Points Identified

### Service Communication
```yaml
coordination-service → postgres, redis, qdrant
hybrid-memory-service → postgres, qdrant, ollama
learning-service → postgres, redis, qdrant, ollama
perception-service → ollama
reasoning-service → postgres, redis, ollama
infrastructure-recovery → postgres, redis, prometheus
```

### API Gateway Integration
- All services expose REST APIs on dedicated ports
- Health check endpoints configured
- Ready for API gateway routing configuration

### Monitoring Integration
- Services configured with health checks
- Prometheus metrics endpoints available
- Grafana dashboards can be configured

## 5. Deployment Action Plan

### Phase 1: Service Activation
```bash
# Deploy cognitive services
docker-compose up -d coordination-service hybrid-memory-service learning-service perception-service reasoning-service
```

### Phase 2: Health Validation
```bash
# Validate service health
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # coordination
curl http://localhost:8002/health  # memory
curl http://localhost:8003/health  # learning
curl http://localhost:8004/health  # perception
curl http://localhost:8005/health  # reasoning
```

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
- Test inter-service communication
- Validate database connections
- Verify Ollama model access
- Test Redis caching

### Phase 4: Performance Validation
- Load testing with concurrent requests
- Memory usage monitoring
- Response time analysis
- Resource optimization

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks
1. **Resource Consumption**: Multiple AI services may strain system resources
2. **Model Loading**: Ollama model loading delays during cold starts
3. **Database Connections**: Connection pool management across services
4. **Service Discovery**: Inter-service communication routing

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Implement resource limits in docker-compose
2. Pre-warm Ollama models during deployment
3. Configure PgBouncer for connection pooling
4. Use service mesh or API gateway for routing

## 7. Agent Documentation Gaps

### Missing Documentation Files
The following agents lack documentation in `/documentation/agents/`:
- deployment-orchestrator
- infrastructure-orchestrator
- production-endpoint-validator
- user-experience-auditor
- backend-gateway-expert
- fullstack-communication-auditor
- schema-database-expert
- monitoring-analyst
- performance-profiler
- test-automation-engineer
- Most other specialist agents

### Registry Completeness
- ✅ `.claude/agents/` directory contains agent definitions
- ✅ `AGENT_REGISTRY.md` lists agents with recursion prevention
- ⚠️ Documentation directory needs population

## 8. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Deploy Cognitive Services**: Execute docker-compose deployment
2. **Validate Health Endpoints**: Confirm all services respond
3. **Test Integration Points**: Verify inter-service communication
4. **Configure Monitoring**: Set up Prometheus scraping for new services

### Documentation Requirements
1. Create missing agent documentation files
2. Update DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md with all agents
3. Establish cross-references between related agents
4. Document cognitive service integration patterns

### Performance Optimization
1. Configure resource limits for each service
2. Implement connection pooling strategies
3. Set up caching layers for frequently accessed data
4. Monitor and optimize Ollama model loading
