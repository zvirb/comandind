- infrastructure-orchestrator entry updated (2025-08-15)
- Total documented agents: 29/49 (59% coverage)

## 5. Integration Achievements

### Agent Registry Completeness
- 49 total agents registered and integrated
- All agents have recursion prevention headers
- Capabilities matrix maintained with expertise levels
- Collaboration patterns documented

### Cross-Agent Awareness
- Bidirectional relationships established
- Shared resources documented
- Integration points mapped
- Communication protocols defined

## 6. Next Steps for Cognitive Services Deployment

### Immediate Actions (Phase 2-5)
1. **Deploy Services**: Execute `docker-compose up -d` for cognitive services
2. **Validate Health**: Check all health endpoints respond correctly
3. **Test Integration**: Verify inter-service communication
4. **Configure Monitoring**: Add Prometheus scraping for new services
5. **Performance Testing**: Load test cognitive services

### Deployment Command
```bash
docker-compose up -d \
  coordination-service \
  hybrid-memory-service \
  learning-service \
  perception-service \
  reasoning-service \
  infrastructure-recovery-service
```

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Health checks
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # coordination
curl http://localhost:8002/health  # memory
curl http://localhost:8003/health  # learning
curl http://localhost:8004/health  # perception
curl http://localhost:8005/health  # reasoning
curl http://localhost:8010/health  # recovery
```

## 7. Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks
1. **Resource Consumption**: 6 new AI services may strain system
2. **Model Loading**: Cold start delays for Ollama models
3. **Connection Pools**: Database connection management
4. **Service Discovery**: Inter-service routing complexity

### Mitigation Strategies
- Resource limits configured in docker-compose
- Connection pooling via PgBouncer
- Health checks and restart policies
- Service mesh consideration for routing
