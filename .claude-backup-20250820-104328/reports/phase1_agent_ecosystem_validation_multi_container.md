## üéØ AGENT COORDINATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: UI Deployment (IMMEDIATE)
**Lead**: deployment-orchestrator
**Support**: webui-architect
**Tasks**:
1. Deploy Documents/Calendar features to production
2. Validate Docker Compose service integration
3. Confirm routing and navigation functionality
4. Enable UI-triggered authentication testing

### Phase 2: Multi-Layer Auth Analysis
**Lead**: security-validator
**Support**: backend-gateway-expert
**Tasks**:
1. Map JWT token flow across container boundaries
2. Validate mTLS certificates between services
3. Analyze Redis session coordination
4. Identify authentication failure points

### Phase 3: Service Communication Debug
**Lead**: infrastructure-orchestrator
**Support**: monitoring-analyst
**Tasks**:
1. Debug container-to-container authentication
2. Validate Docker network routing and DNS
3. Monitor service health during auth flows
4. Identify service dependency issues

### Phase 4: End-to-End Validation
**Lead**: user-experience-auditor
**Support**: production-endpoint-validator
**Tasks**:
1. Test Documents/Calendar navigation
2. Validate authentication persistence
3. Collect evidence of success/failure
4. Provide comprehensive validation report

## üìä ECOSYSTEM READINESS ASSESSMENT

### Strengths
- ‚úÖ All required agents present and operational
- ‚úÖ Multi-container expertise confirmed across specialists
- ‚úÖ Evidence-based validation requirements understood
- ‚úÖ Deployment capabilities verified for UI features

### Critical Success Factors
1. **UI Deployment First**: Must deploy Documents/Calendar before testing
2. **Multi-Layer Debugging**: Coordinate JWT, mTLS, and API key analysis
3. **Service Isolation**: Debug each container's authentication separately
4. **Evidence Collection**: Mandatory proof for all validation claims

### Risk Mitigation
- **Deployment Failure**: deployment-orchestrator has rollback procedures
- **Auth Complexity**: security-validator can analyze all three layers
- **Service Dependencies**: infrastructure-orchestrator manages orchestration
- **False Positives**: Evidence requirements prevent incorrect success claims

## üöÄ RECOMMENDED EXECUTION ORDER

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Deploy Documents/Calendar UI features (deployment-orchestrator + webui-architect)
2. **THEN**: Analyze multi-layer authentication (security-validator + backend-gateway-expert)
3. **PARALLEL**: Debug service communication (infrastructure-orchestrator + monitoring-analyst)
4. **FINALLY**: End-to-end validation (user-experience-auditor + production-endpoint-validator)

## ‚úÖ VALIDATION CONCLUSION

**ECOSYSTEM STATUS**: READY FOR MULTI-CONTAINER DEBUGGING

The agent ecosystem has ALL required capabilities for:
- ‚úÖ Deploying UI features to production Docker Compose
- ‚úÖ Debugging three-layer authentication system
- ‚úÖ Analyzing 15+ container service architecture
- ‚úÖ Validating service-to-service communication
- ‚úÖ Providing evidence-based validation

**CRITICAL PATH IDENTIFIED**:
1. Deploy UI features (unblocks testing)
2. Debug authentication layers (identifies root cause)
3. Validate fixes (confirms resolution)

**SUCCESS PROBABILITY**: HIGH
- All agents have required expertise
- Clear coordination strategy defined
- Evidence requirements prevent false positives
- Rollback procedures available if needed
