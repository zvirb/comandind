# ðŸŽ® GAME ENGINE EMERGENCY CONTEXT PACKAGE
## ECS World Class & Entity Management Crisis (4,000 tokens max)

### IMMEDIATE CRITICAL ERROR
**Priority 1 Fix Required**: `TypeError: this.world.cleanup is not a function`
- **Location**: ECS system attempting to call cleanup on World instance
- **Impact**: Application crashes, prevents game startup
- **Fix Scope**: Add cleanup() method to World class or create alias

### ECS WORLD CLASS ANALYSIS REQUIRED

#### Current World Class Structure Investigation:
```javascript
// Expected in: src/ecs/World.js or similar
class World {
  constructor() {
    this.entities = new Map();
    this.components = new Map(); 
    this.systems = [];
  }
  
  // MISSING: cleanup() method causing the error
  // Required: Implement cleanup to prevent crashes
}
```

#### Entity Creation vs Rendering Pipeline Issue:
**Problem**: Users see "green spinning squares" instead of RTS game elements
**Investigation Required**:
1. **Entity Creation**: Are entities being created but not rendering?
2. **Component Assignment**: Are components properly attached to entities?
3. **Rendering Integration**: Does PixiJS receive proper entity data?
4. **Sprite Creation**: Are sprites being created from entity data?

#### PixiJS Sprite Display System:
```javascript
// Expected integration pattern:
class RenderingSystem {
  update(entities) {
    entities.forEach(entity => {
      // Are sprites being created for each entity?
      // Are sprites added to the stage properly?
      // Do sprites reflect entity component data?
    });
  }
}
```

### COMPONENT SYSTEM INTEGRATION
#### Required Analysis:
- **Position Component**: Entity positioning vs sprite positioning
- **Sprite Component**: Texture assignment and visual representation
- **Transform Component**: Scale, rotation, visibility states
- **Game Object Component**: Unit type, building type, resource type

### ENTITY LIFECYCLE INVESTIGATION
#### Creation Pipeline:
1. **Entity Registration**: `world.createEntity()`
2. **Component Assignment**: `entity.addComponent()`
3. **System Processing**: Systems should process entities
4. **Rendering Update**: Sprites should reflect entity state

#### Missing Link Analysis:
- Are entities created but systems not processing them?
- Are systems processing but not updating sprites?
- Are sprites created but not visible (positioning/layer issues)?
- Are components properly structured for rendering?

### PERFORMANCE METRICS CORRELATION
#### Current Status:
- **Technical Performance**: 64,809 FPS (excellent)
- **Health Checks**: 0.491ms (excellent)
- **User Experience**: BROKEN (only green squares)

#### Investigation Required:
- High performance suggests entity creation is working
- Missing gameplay suggests rendering/display issues
- Need to correlate entity count with sprite count

### CRITICAL DEBUGGING POINTS
1. **Console Errors**: Check for ECS-related errors beyond cleanup
2. **Entity Count**: Verify entities are being created
3. **Component Verification**: Ensure components are properly attached
4. **Sprite Creation**: Verify PixiJS sprites are generated
5. **Stage Addition**: Confirm sprites are added to display stage
6. **Texture Loading**: Verify game textures are loading properly

### EMERGENCY FIX PRIORITY ORDER
1. **Fix cleanup() method** - Immediate crash prevention
2. **Verify entity creation** - Ensure entities exist
3. **Check component attachment** - Verify component system
4. **Investigate sprite rendering** - PixiJS integration
5. **Validate display pipeline** - End-to-end rendering

### SUCCESS CRITERIA
âœ… No ECS cleanup errors in console
âœ… Entities successfully created in World
âœ… Components properly attached to entities
âœ… Systems processing entities correctly
âœ… PixiJS sprites created and displayed
âœ… Game elements visible (not just green squares)
âœ… Performance maintained during fixes

### TOOLS REQUIRED
- **Read**: Examine ECS system files and World class
- **Edit**: Fix cleanup method and any integration issues
- **Bash**: Test application startup and error checking
- **Grep**: Search for entity creation and rendering patterns
- **LS/Glob**: Locate ECS system files and dependencies

### COORDINATION
- **Report findings** to Main Claude for integration
- **Coordinate with** codebase-research-analyst for system investigation
- **Support** ui-regression-debugger with entity/sprite correlation
- **Ensure** atomic-git-synchronizer for rollback capability
