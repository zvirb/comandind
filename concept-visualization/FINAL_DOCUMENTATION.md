## Sprite System

### Organization

The sprite system is organized into three priority levels for optimal loading performance:

**High Priority (6 sprites)**
- Essential terrain tiles for immediate rendering
- Basic sand, dirt, water, and tiberium sprites

**Medium Priority (10 sprites)**
- Additional terrain variations
- Core structures (Construction Yard, Barracks, Mammoth Tank)

**Low Priority (20+ sprites)**
- Full terrain set with variations
- Additional units and structures
- Advanced visual effects

### Sprite Paths

All sprites are located at `/public/assets/sprites/cnc-png/` with the following structure:

```
cnc-png/
├── terrain/           # Terrain tiles (S01, D01, B1, etc.)
├── individual/        # Extracted individual sprites
├── structures/        # Building sprites
└── medium-tank-*.png  # Direct tank sprites
```

## Device Optimization

### Performance Tiers

The system automatically detects device capabilities and adjusts accordingly:

**Low-End Devices**
- Reduced canvas resolution (max 800x600)
- Skip texture atlas creation
- Load only high/medium priority sprites
- Simplified animations

**Medium-End Devices**
- Standard canvas resolution (max 1280x960)
- Limited texture atlas
- Progressive sprite loading
- Standard feature set

**High-End Devices**
- Full resolution support
- Complete texture atlas
- All sprites loaded
- Advanced features enabled

### Mobile Optimizations

- Touch gesture recognition (tap, pan, pinch, long press)
- Responsive layout adaptation
- Orientation change handling
- Memory management for mobile browsers
- Battery-conscious rendering

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start

1. **Open the Comprehensive Demo**
   ```
   Open: concept-visualization/comprehensive-demo.html
   ```

2. **Select Programming Concepts**
   - Use the sidebar to navigate between concepts
   - Click on any concept to see it visualized
   - On mobile, tap the hamburger menu to access the sidebar

3. **Test System Features**
   - Switch to the "Features" tab to explore RTS capabilities
   - Use the "Tests" tab to validate system performance

### Running Tests

1. **Integration Validation**
   ```
   Open: concept-visualization/integration-validation.html
   Click: "Run All Tests" for comprehensive validation
   ```

2. **Mobile Interface Testing**
   ```
   Open: concept-visualization/mobile-interface-test.html
   Test touch gestures, performance, and responsiveness
   ```

3. **Sprite Access Verification**
   ```
   Open: concept-visualization/test-sprite-access.html
   Verify all 2,762 sprites load correctly
   ```

### Development

1. **Local Testing**
   ```bash
   # Start a local server
   python3 -m http.server 8081
   
   # Open in browser
   http://localhost:8081/concept-visualization/comprehensive-demo.html
